Overall Structure

The diagram describes how a 2-hour block is divided into two 1-hour segments:

Hour 1 (H1)

Hour 2 (H2)

Each hour is further divided into slots, each lasting 20 minutes.

Hour 1 → S1, S2, S3

Hour 2 → S4, S5, S6

Slots (Slot Level – Blue)

Each slot represents a 20-minute time window.

S1–S6 are the six slots across the 2-hour block.

Groups (Group Level – Pink)

Groups combine slots into 40-minute sessions:

Group 1 (G1): S1 (H1) + S4 (H2) → Priority Group

Group 2 (G2): S2 (H1) + S5 (H2) → Flexible Group

Group 3 (G3): S3 (H1) + S6 (H2) → Priority Group

So, groups always link one slot from H1 with a corresponding slot from H2.

Availability Levels (Green)

This part explains how applicants are assigned groups/slots depending on whether they are available for just H1, just H2, or both.

If applicant has H1 only → they can only do slots in H1.

Prefer G1 (which includes S1)

Or just S1 if grouping isn’t possible

If applicant has both H1 and H2 → best option is G2 (S2 + S5), since it requires presence across both hours.

If applicant has H2 only → they can only do slots in H2.

Prefer G3 (which includes S6)

Overflow Slots

S3 and S4 are designated as overflow slots, used when primary groups (G1, G2, G3) are filled.

Summary in Plain Words

This setup ensures that:

Time is neatly divided into 20-minute slots within a 2-hour block.

Groups (40 min) are formed by pairing one slot from H1 with one from H2.

Depending on whether someone is available only in H1, only in H2, or in both, they are assigned to different groups/slots.

Priority is given to groups G1 and G3 (which tie across hours), while G2 is flexible and S3/S4 serve as backups.

Do you want me to also redraw this as a simplified table/flowchart in text form so it’s easier to visualize without the diagram?


Good question — there actually isn’t time overlap between the slots themselves, because each slot is a sequential 20-minute segment.

Here’s how they line up in the 2-hour block:

Hour 1 (H1):

S1: 0:00 – 0:20

S2: 0:20 – 0:40

S3: 0:40 – 1:00

Hour 2 (H2):

S4: 1:00 – 1:20

S5: 1:20 – 1:40

S6: 1:40 – 2:00

So the slots don’t overlap in time.

👉 The “overlap” you might be noticing in the diagram isn’t temporal — it’s grouping overlap:

Groups combine slots from both hours.

G1 overlaps S1 and S4 (spanning both hours).

G2 overlaps S2 and S5.

G3 overlaps S3 and S6.

That means an applicant assigned to a group must be available in both slots, even though they happen at different times.
