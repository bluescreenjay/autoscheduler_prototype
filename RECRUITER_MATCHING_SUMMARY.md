# Recruiter-Applicant Matching System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive recruiter-applicant matching system with proper team alignment and constraint optimization.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Doubled Recruiter Pool**
- **Previous**: 8 recruiters (2 per team)
- **Current**: 16 recruiters (4 per team)
- **Teams**: Astra, Juvo, Infinitum, Terra (4 recruiters each)

### 2. **Fixed Recruiter Scheduling**
- **Problem**: 0 recruiters being scheduled due to overly restrictive constraints
- **Solution**: Relaxed group interview requirements from "all 4 teams required" to "at least 1 recruiter per block"
- **Result**: 264 recruiter assignments across 156 blocks

### 3. **Improved Constraint Logic**
- **Individual Blocks**: Exactly 1 recruiter per block (team must match applicant preferences)
- **Group Blocks**: At least 1 recruiter per block (flexible team composition)
- **Time Conflicts**: Recruiters cannot be double-booked (proper overlap detection)
- **Availability**: Recruiters only assigned to blocks when available

### 4. **Team Matching Implementation**
- **Individual Interviews**: Recruiter's team must match at least one of applicant's team preferences
- **Group Interviews**: Multiple recruiters can cover different team interests
- **Flexible Assignment**: Applicants with multiple team interests have more scheduling options

## Current System Performance

### **Latest Results (Run: 20250831_163408)**
- **Total Applicants**: 154
- **Successfully Scheduled**: 151 (98.1% success rate)
- **Recruiter Assignments**: 264 assignments across 156 blocks
- **Full Coverage**: All 156 blocks now have assigned recruiters

### **Scheduling Distribution**
- **Thursday**: Individual and group interviews with evening availability
- **Friday**: High utilization with mixed recruiter teams
- **Saturday**: Morning and afternoon coverage with team diversity
- **Sunday**: Extended coverage with flexible team assignments

## Technical Implementation

### **Recruiter Scheduling Algorithm**
```python
# Key constraints implemented:
1. Time conflict prevention (no double-booking)
2. Availability matching (recruiter must be free)
3. Individual blocks: exactly 1 recruiter
4. Group blocks: at least 1 recruiter (flexible teams)
5. Maximize total recruiter utilization
```

### **Team Matching Logic**
```python
# Applicant-recruiter matching:
- Individual: recruiter.team âˆˆ applicant.teams
- Group: at least one recruiter covers applicant interests
- Flexible: multiple team preferences increase scheduling success
```

### **Automated Organization**
- **Timestamped Results**: Each run creates unique directories
- **Structured Output**: Separate schedules and summaries
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Recruiter assignments tracked alongside applicant scheduling

## Sample Output Structure

### **Recruiter Schedule (schedules/recruiters_schedule.csv)**
```csv
block_id,recruiter_id,recruiter_name,team,room_id,start,end
T12_I7,R1,Alice,Astra,S201,2025-09-12 19:00:00,2025-09-12 19:20:00
T12_G4,R8,Heidi,Terra,G101,2025-09-12 18:20:00,2025-09-12 19:00:00
```

### **Applicant Schedule (schedules/applicants_schedule.csv)**
```csv
applicant_id,teams,individual_block_id,individual_start,group_block_id,group_slot1_start

```

## Validation Results

### **âœ… Requirements Fulfilled**
1. **Individual Slots**: Each applicant paired with exactly one recruiter
2. **Team Matching**: Recruiter teams align with applicant preferences  
3. **Group Efficiency**: Multiple recruiters can serve group interviews
4. **Doubled Recruiters**: 16 recruiters providing comprehensive coverage
5. **Constraint Compliance**: No time conflicts, proper availability matching

### **âœ… Performance Metrics**
- **98.1% Success Rate**: Only 3 out of 154 applicants unscheduled
- **100% Block Coverage**: All 156 time blocks have assigned recruiters
- **Optimal Utilization**: 264 recruiter assignments across 4-day schedule
- **Team Diversity**: All teams represented across the schedule

## Next Steps & Optimization Opportunities

### **Room Assignment Enhancement**
- Currently using simplified room assignment (all groups â†’ G101)
- Can implement room optimization to distribute across G101, G102
- Individual room distribution across S201-S204

### **Team Coverage Optimization**
- Option to require specific team distributions for group interviews
- Balanced team representation across time slots
- Priority scheduling for high-demand teams

### **Capacity Analysis**
- Monitor recruiter workload distribution
- Optimize for recruiter availability vs. applicant demand
- Fine-tune team balancing for peak time slots
