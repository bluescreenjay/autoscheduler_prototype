As a member of this community my mission of gracious professionalism and cooperation fosters a spirit of inclusivity and understanding, celebrating diversity and learning to appreciate different perspectives and experiences. I have learnt to be receptive to new ideas from diverse teams, grown to appreciate their experiences, inspired by their journeys and during competitions developed technical skills to challenge teams on the field.","I'm currently working with studios such as Squared Media (@SquardMediaYT) and Parrot (@ParrotX2) with a following base of more than millions. Although my story telling and animation skills that I apply there aren't exactly needed here, my collaboration skills have brought me far in the studios. We work together as a team- what makes us united isn't that we act as one but rather the different ideas we each provide to cultivate the final product. Apart from that aspect, feedback is another huge thing that I gladly accept. At first, I've gotten paragraphs of feedback from both studios telling me what to fix in my animation, story, etc, and I've been able to adapt and understand how they want me to work and continue. I would accept any criticism on the design team and my collaboration work is what makes me confident in proving to be a valuable member.

The ability to float ideas around, use each other’s strengths to further project goals, and to learn about and from different people are just the best things ever. Plus you’ll always have someone to yap to.","I’m really passionate about my work, and when I’m passionate I lock in. I can present things by heart, and I will spend time on my own researching and working on projects, developing them on my own time so that I’ve always got a fresh idea to bring to the table.

In high school our robotics team competed in FTC, which functionally was a massive group project. I honestly really enjoyed it, not only because of the competition, but because I got to work with people who have similar interests to myself. That team was a great example to me that I am great at communication and collaborating with others, but one area of growth was to better manage teaching and training in a team setting. Often times it was easy to delegate, but you can't delegate if they do not have the knowhow. I am overall decent at training people, but finding the balance, which I think is true for all team settings is difficult and something to constantly work at. Other than that, I have made mobile applications on the iOS store with friends, I have made business applications at work with colleagues, done multitudes of school projects in groups, and worked on process in cross functional settings at work. I really love working with other people due to how it broadens the skill set you can apply to a problem, and I love to problem solve in a group setting. I function a lot worse on my own, so I frankly prefer to work in a team setting even if it requires additional work in communication and documentation, which I have found to be a strong suit. All in all, I work well with other people, and honestly prefer it.","I believe my past experiences both with teams and my technical experience make me a valuable member to one of the design teams. I have a large amount of experience in robotics and in automation, as I interned the past two summers in automation and have been on a robotics team for the past six years along with completing multiple engineering related personal projects like an automated garage door closer if I left it open for too long. From these experiences I mostly have software experience, namely Java, Dart, Python, C++, C#, Git, SQL, and Flutter to name what I have large amounts of experience with. I have worked with many more frameworks and languages, and I tend to pick up new languages relatively quickly. I believe I have the technical know how to build applications or robots as needed from my past experience with both - making an app for the app store and competing in robotics for such a long time. In addition to the technical skills, I think the team skills I outlined above make me a great fit for an collaborative environment such as Archimedes. I really love to problem solve, and at its core that is what goes on in Archimedes in each program, a problem is prevented and we design engineering solutions to meet the problems to the best of our abilities. The last thing I want to mention is the passion I have for both Terra and Infinitum. I love robotics, and terra, solving problems with code is what I do in my free time already.","I am really excited to get involved with engineering and robotics in college and am ready to learn pretty much anything and everything that is required to solve a problem or to figure out a solution to a problem. I just wanted to add that though I do have previous experience, I ultimately think what is more important is my readiness and excitement to learn new things to conquer new problems rather than the skillset I bring to the table.

My role was always planning and dynamic support - We always had people who had specific interests on our team, who would be uniquely skilled in certain aspects, and so I would pick up the slack and be the person who connected the work, and worked on what nobody else was working on. Of course, when I was in smaller teams, I would pick up my own share of the pie as well, but the larger the team, the more spread out my role became.

As a leader of the design team, my responsibility was not only to input ideas that would help make our bot better, but I oversaw other members and ensured that even though each individual was working on their own ideas, that the final product would come together seamlessly. An example of this was helping to combine the ideas of those responsible for designing the part of the robot which would complete the challenge (such as the claw and lift) with those who built the actual moving body.","Besides my past experiences working with robots and various design teams, I have a deep interest in becoming a biomedical engineer and building products which bring genuine change into people's lives.

I had a lot of Projects in physics during my senior year. We did one where we calculated the trajectory of a metal ball that would roll down a ramp onto the table and roll off the table into a cup that was a few inches off the ground. In those team settings, I was more of the leader of these groups but I also wanted to support them in any way that I could. I had a little bit of a hard time with the team projects in high school mainly because a lot of the people who were a part of them didn't really want to do anything or didn't care about the project very much which was frustrating. I still got along with the groups I just picked up the work that the others in my group didn't want. My teams still got all of their work done and it was a successful project but I had to help guide and direct them a lot more to make sure that everything was organized and didn't just look like 3 or 4 people who worked on a project alone and just jammed all of these things together. I tried to mesh it so that we were all working together and helping each other so that we were one group.
","I would be a valuable member of the team because I am desperate to learn. I live by the word Yet. I put that word after every time that I say I can't do something. I can't understand this math Yet. I can't get this part to work Yet. Just because I don't know everything right now doesn't mean that I can't be helpful and learn it, I know that I can understand and learn anything that I put my mind to.  I am a hard worker and I am interested in all of the teams and think that they all have some very valuable things that they will be teaching. I get along with everyone, I think that no matter what group of people you put around me I can adapt and get along with them and work with them to complete the project and have a very successful group. I am willing to do anything with the group even if that means that I am cleaning up the table at the end of the day. I love working with people who have the same desire as I do and have a really good time checking work with people and collaborating on creating new things. I think that working in design teams gets the best out of everyone because where some of us might slack behind and not understand the concept as well there are others in the group that thrive in that area and help to teach everyone else.
","I would like to say thank you for taking the time to review my submission. I had a really great time going to the informational session on August 31st and learning about all four programs they all have such awesome projects to work on. I got a chance to talk to AV I believe and he was very insightful about the whole project and how interesting and cool the projects can be. I also think that this is one of the coolest and most fascinating clubs. I have never seen a club that was specific to only freshmen in engineering and I think it's one of the coolest things that I have seen. Even if I am not selected for an interview or a group I hope that the Archimedes group thrives and continues on for many years to come. I think that the learning experiences that the freshmen in the group are going to get this year are unparalleled to any other group that I could join as a freshman and would help me with other clubs and projects in the future where I can try and step into a more helpful role at the start instead of sitting on the sideline.

I believe I functioned well in a team. There were occasions where our teams would have growing pains but eventually there would be realization that the only way we could be successful is if we listened to each other's research and ideas. When tasked to construct a tower that needed to withstand a heavy load, there was too much ground for one person to cover. We would not have built such a sturdy structure my teammates and I did not consider each other’s proposals. I came to appreciate the importance of communication. In one of our assignments, a mousetrap catapult car, The way my group designed the propulsion of the catapult would have never launched if we didn’t collaborate with the mousetrap car team. To achieve project goals we had to effectively spread information within our subteams and then up to the core team. I can be a stickler about deadlines and material but overall the STEM program helped me become a better communicator and listener.","In my past teams, I have been willing to invest effort to learn new skills and put in extra time to make certain the project succeeded. In one collaborative project last year we were running out of time because a core element of the design wasn’t operational. We needed to change the way one of our pieces turned to hit another. I came in early before school to adjust the design and reconstruct multiple pieces. In another project, we had to do some laser cutting. I invested the time to figure out how to properly use the laser cutter. Eventually the instructor sent students to me so that I would teach others. I am not as qualified with programming as I would like, but I think there are other areas where I can contribute. I am enthusiastic to learn and participate.",,,,

It was about choosing and presenting a project to elementary school kids. We were divided into teams, and my team decided on the calcium carbide cannon. 
How it works is that we put water and calcium carbide metal in a PVC pipe, close off one end and stuff the other end with a towel, then wait for the water to react with the calcium carbide to produce acetylene gas. After that, we lit a lighter and put it close to a hole on the PVC pipe. The oxygen would react with the acetylene gas and cause a combustion reaction. Which would cause the towel to be shot out. 
I was in charge of locating the optimal amount of calcium carbide for creating the biggest launch which was very important. If there’s too much, there isn't going to be enough oxygen in the PVC pipe to react with the acetylene gas which could make the reaction not go off. If there’s too little, the combustion reaction isn’t enough to push out the towel. After finding the total volume of the PVC pipe, calculating out how many moles of oxygen was in the tube, and the temperature of that day. I was able to use PV=NRT to find the optimized amount of the metal. 
I weighed out 7-8 trials worth of carbide metal and placed them individually in some zipper bags. And I made sure we had everything ready on the day of the presentation. During the presentation, despite minor issues, the others and I were able to work around it and it went well in the end. ","I have been modeling for around 4 years. Truth to be told, I of course don’t model everyday but I am pretty sure that I have spent over 200+ hours on the modeling software called “Fusion 360”. 
I first learned about that software back in 9th grade in a course called “Engineering Drawing”, where we learned the basics of that software. Sadly, my school doesn’t offer any advanced courses with that software. So I decided to learn by myself. I found video tutorials online and followed them step by step and learned from them. I did a lot more practice on my own to improve and explore the software myself, playing around with the different tools and settings to test out new strategies and methods. I also went to the teacher who taught the course and sought help from him. I believe that my experience with modeling exemplifies my attitude toward learning. I am not afraid to learn on my own in order to supplement what I am taught in my classes. 
I have made a lot of models over the years. They range from cheap mechanical pencils to the school laptop that I used for 4 years in high school. Some of them took only 1-2 hours to make yet some of these took over 20 hours. 
With my knowledge in modeling, I can help design machine pieces for the other members, for example casing and structures. I have longed to make something that is more complex but couldn’t due to my lack of skill in coding and electronics. Now I wish to work with other members to learn from them, and improve together.

They split is up into groups giving us the objective of making the furthest flying paper airplane possible. It seems simple but in reality, aerodynamics is not a simple thing. Other groups used youtube tutorials, however I made our group think outside the box. We may have made one of the weirdest looking airplanes, however it flew the furthest and we won the contest by a landslide. When I'm on a team, I hold all members to the same standard I'm on. I like when people come up with their own ideas. On a team I usually am the ""coordinator"" since I not only do my part in the team, but make sure other people are putting their work in. I am also a extroverted person so communication is never a problem with me, if anything I feel I exceed. Long story short, I love working in a team environment and it gives me the confidence to complete any challenge knowing great minds think alike.","I would be a valuable member to one of your design teams for multiple reasons. The first one that I think is most important is my leadership skills. I have past experience in leadership positions such as club president roles in high school and I also used to be a peer mentor. My second trait that makes me a valuable member for your design team is my dedication to design process. When I focus on a design project, I get physically irritated if it isn't perfect, which pushes me to work harder. This is one quality about me that I feel is important, because it makes me a hard worker and periodically a overachiever.

One of my best experiences working on a group project was in a year-long passion project. For this project my friends and I decided to create a club where we interviewed our school athletes and coaches. It was very fun and rewarding, as we averaged an attendance of over 20 through our near weekly meetings. Our group worked very well together, and we each played an important role on the team. One of my biggest roles was keeping the team focused on what we had to accomplish when we met to do work. Because we were great friends, this was often challenging, but I acted as a strong anchor for the team. 
In addition to anchoring the team, my group mates and I constantly bounce ideas off each other, trying to think of any way to improve the project at hand. This was especially true for my engineering projects at school where we had to solve a specific problem with the given constraints. For example, in my senior year we had a project where we were assigned partners to create a 3D printed phone holder. After giving time for each of us to develop some sketches of our ideas, we talked them over and ultimately incorporated features from both our ideas into our final product. Overall, I would say I have a strong experience working in group projects and some of my most important team functions are keeping the team on task and helping to brainstorm ideas.","Currently, I am undecided in my engineering discipline. This is because I am so fascinated by the intricacies and applications of each field I struggle to pick one to represent me. However, this just makes me more eager to learn skills and apply what I learn in hopes that something does stick out. I would be a dedicated and well rounded worker not only because I want the team to succeed, but because I want to find what I am most passionate about. Beyond these soft skills, I have technical skills in AutoCad with 3D modeling, isometric pictorials and orthographic projections. This can be utilized to create working drawings and print 3D parts.

What was originally going to be a tedious group project turned into a very enjoyable afternoon as a result of working together with the same goal. I think I helped facilitate the attitude of being goal focused and actually getting the job done, all while allowing for enjoyment and bonding.","I can work well with others, regardless of their attitude and experience. I enjoy not being the smartest or most enthusiastic person in the room, but that doesn't detract from my ability to help others mesh as a team when I happen to be. Also, this is a design team that requires passion and focus, and I believe that I can learn very quickly when I have a well defined goal.  I recognize that there are things I'm not good at (like avoiding busy schedules, for example) However, I think that knowing where you are skilled and where you can improve is a skill in itself.","I walked through the rain for 20 minutes to get to the interest meeting.

The entire process - from choosing a project to prototype testing - was self-directed. It took initiative and creativity to identify a problem, design a solution, implement CAD and electrical components, code, and polish up the result. The two of us learned the basics of CAD, electronics, and code, but we allocated work based on strengths. My partner who had aphantasia (cannot visualize images) struggled with the spatial aspect of 3D printing, so I primarily handled CAD while she focused on coding. Together we taught ourselves skills, communicated our respective tasks, and collaborated efficiently to finish our projects over the span of a month.

Last summer, I mentored at JLAB, again with a partner. We started as complete strangers and learned to communicate our strengths and weaknesses regarding the assignment: documenting our mentor’s original AI system. I had practically no coding literacy, but luckily my partner had a strong programming background, and I was willing to learn. He taught me to interpret the back-end code, which allowed me to document the various methods and objects throughout the code. Additionally, my attention to detail and lack of proficiency in programming aided us in finding errors in our mentor’s code and our website. 

These instances show that I’m willing to put in extra time and effort to compensate for my and others’ weaknesses.
","Through engineering projects and mentorships, I’ve gained basic proficiency in CAD, electronics, soldering, and some coding. The soft skills that contribute most to my success in these technical skills are strong visualization, being detail oriented, and having enthusiasm! 

I’ve always valued the informative power of a detailed diagram or drawing. This skill has been applicable in everyday learning, digesting and relaying information, and design projects. Specifically, visualization and spatial awareness help me design in CAD and understand how electronics will interact with those parts. 

While some find detailed work tedious and boring, I enjoy the focus required to spot missing semicolons in code or track thin, yard-long wires to their respective pins. This skill also helps me consider nuances of design, like whether a user could easily find information on a website or if the bolts on a wearable device would be agitating for the wearer.

Most importantly, I love learning and am committed to putting in the time and effort needed for personal growth and the success of the team. In the past, I’ve demonstrated proactivity by reaching out to shadow physicians at my local hospital and applying to mentorships. As a member of Archimedes, I’d find immense gratification growing with my team as we apply, improve, and expand our current skill sets while embracing challenges!
","While my academic group projects have generally been small groups, four years of varsity volleyball has taught me how to function in large teams as well. As an upperclassman and co-captain, I learned to mediate disagreements and communicate concerns with my teammates and coaches. As a fellow player, I learned that my greatest team assets are adaptability, resilience, and the ability to motivate by example.",,,

I was the manufacturing officer my sophomore year, the mechanical director my junior year, and the president my senior year. I worked well with my team; I was friendly with all the members and made sure to include everyone I could. One of my biggest accomplishments was introducing a new team productivity system named Trello, that our team still uses to keep track of tasks and goals. The team improved communication since then, which was the goal. Another project I worked on as a group was a hydrogen generator that used electrolysis, for a senior year engineering capstone project. We won 1st place in our engineering fair, as we surpassed the industry standard for efficiency in a hydrogen generator that used electrolysis. Overall, in both my group projects, I was very inclusive, friendly, led discussions and organized meetings. Staying on task and being goal-oriented was one of the main things I encouraged as a leader on my teams, and whenever a teammate was struggling, I would ensure that I could help them meet their goals, whether that meant asking another student to help them or helping them myself. An important note though, is that if their reasoning for falling behind was a lack of training, I made sure to take the time to properly train them, instead of just doing the task for them. ","I believe I would be a valuable member to your Terra design team because of its focus on building a robot towards a goal. I have vast experience with that process, both from the four years of engineering classes I took, as well as spending four years on both a FTC and FRC robotics team. Over my high school career, I have gone through a “build season” of sorts 8 times and I am very acquainted with going through the design process for robots. On my teams, I worked with every department, ensuring that the final robot was designed in mind with the mechanical, coding, and electrical aspects. I ensured that everyone was included in design discussions, no matter their experience or department, as I believed that everyone has a unique and valuable perspective. I have experience with the engineering design process, CAD, machinery such as a CNC, Lathe, and End Mill, assembly with both hand tools and powered tools, electrical experience soldering and wiring circuits, and I have basic knowledge of programming in Java. In addition, when I commit to a project I am fully committed. For high school, I committed an average of 25-30 hours a week to working on the robot. I believe my extensive robotics knowledge and experience would make me a valuable member of the team, as this is the sort of competition I am used to.

We would enter these robots into competitions. For my team I was one of the main drivers and engineers. I would drive, design, make and assist in programming the robots. To be successful we needed to work as a team and communication was an important part of it as tasks like driving the robot would require two drivers to successfully control the robot. Also when designing we needed to communicate with the programing members so that the new design would function properly.

My group projects have involved diverse technologies and platforms, giving me ample experience in collaborative environments.

For example, in GeriCare, a healthcare management solution, I worked closely with my team. Together, we designed a mobile app to digitize patient charts and medical documents. I was responsible for building the entire Flutter frontend while actively collaborating with the backend team to ensure seamless integration with the Django backend. This project honed my communication skills, as we frequently coordinated features to meet hospital requirements.

Similarly, during the development of Examined, a comprehensive academic companion app, I worked in a team to integrate various academic tools using Dart and RAG technology. My role was primarily focused on creating features like an expected marks calculator and mark tracking system. We worked as a cohesive unit, ensuring that all components aligned smoothly to enhance the user experience.

In both hackathons and professional settings, I've consistently taken an active role in both technical execution and team coordination, leveraging strong problem-solving and analytical skills to contribute effectively.","I would be a valuable member of your design team due to my strong technical background, creative problem-solving, and collaborative approach. In my project VaxiCheck, an Android app for tracking vaccination schedules, I designed the user interface with a focus on clarity, accessibility, and user experience. By balancing the need for an intuitive design with robust functionality, I ensured the app catered to both tech-savvy and non-tech-savvy users.

My ability to communicate effectively with my team was key to the project's success, as we worked together to integrate Flutter and Firebase, ensuring seamless user onboarding and data management. I thrive in team environments where diverse perspectives come together to create innovative solutions, and I’m proactive about seeking feedback to improve my designs.

Moreover, my strong foundation in UI/UX design, coupled with my proficiency in various technologies, allows me to bring fresh, yet practical design ideas to the table, ensuring that the final product is both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional.","One additional point to note is that my project VaxiCheck was featured in Bangalore Mirror, a local daily in India, for its innovative approach to tracking vaccinations.

None of us had ever met each other before. None of us had ever been to a hackathon before. Between the four of us, we kind of knew a little Scratch, HTML, and Python. That hackathon was the most stressful one I’d ever been to. We had no idea what we were doing, nobody had ideas for how to get started, and so I organized everybody as best as I could and tried to find some project we could feasibly complete with the little skills we had, even if it wasn’t the best quality. Despite how badly I wanted to go home and never attend another hackathon, I stayed and continued to help these three random seventh graders because I knew they were relying on me for direction and to help complete the project on time. I organized a brainstorming session for coming up with ideas, I divided up the work, I helped troubleshoot problems, I attended the workshops to try and learn something that could help the team, and I made sure things were getting done on time. When I didn’t have anything to do, I helped the team by working solo on a separate side project for a second competition at the hackathon (we were allowed to enter in both competitions). We won second place in both competitions, and I split the money from both competitions with the whole team.","I absolutely love engineering (I took a selfie with a robot at Gobblerfest). Everything about it seems like literal magic and sci-fi come to life, whether it’s light bulbs magically turning on when a mysterious invisible thing called an “electron” flows through them or it’s an equally mysterious and invisible thing called “radio waves” sending signals to make a robot move side to side. I can’t think of any other field in the world I’d be more excited to work in. I also have a track record of following through on my projects. As you’ll see in my resume, I once spent four months grinding out the first ever neural speech recognition system for a whistled language. I knew barely anything about AI at the start of that project, and I didn’t know anybody I could ask for help throughout the entire four months. It was literally just me, ChatGPT, and arxiv whittling away at something I wasn’t even sure was possible. I would love the opportunity to dedicate all my time to Archimedes like how I dedicated it to that project, helping to ensure we build the best product we possibly can and learning as much as I possibly can along the way.

One notable project was FIRST Robotics, where I served as Team Captain and Software Lead. In this role, I led a team of over 15 students in developing the first omnidirectional drive system in our school’s history. I collaborated with my peers in machining, programming (using Java), and designing parts to create a competitive robot. My leadership was recognized with the Dean’s List Award, an honor given to only 200 individuals nationwide. 

In addition, I worked as a research assistant with a team of ecologists, focusing on the decline of the Blanding's Turtle species. Although I initially lacked experience in Ecology, I quickly learned the fundamentals and contributed by developing a machine learning model to predict the species’ life expectancy, and effectively communicated our findings to the public. 

In all group projects I prioritized building strong connections and open communication with peers to the community. Whether engaging with elementary schools to showcase our robots organizing team bonding activities or organizing team bonding activities like pizza parties, I believe fostering a sense of community is essential for a team’s success. I am committed to bringing this value to Archimedes.  ","In my team experience, I have always brought out the best in people. For example, in a team situation I always try to understand my peers on a personal level and find their passions that can help the team succeed.

Additionally, I have experience in developing a framework that allows my peers and myself to stay on track to complete the tasks required for success. I actively track progress using tools like spreadsheets and calendars, which keeps me accountable and organized within the team.  

Driven by curiosity, I have explored a variety of fields such as cryptography, environmental engineering, and machine learning, which have left a positive impact in my community. I hope to further explore applications of engineering fundamentals to broaden my perspective.

I worked to design and build a machine that could efficiently scan the hands of patients. In this internship, I worked with a graduate professor and another intern from the US. Given the language barrier, communication turned out to be the most important factor for success. 

At the beginning, the professor set up goals and a timeline for the project. My peer and I began brainstorming possible approaches to the problem. I made sure to become available at any time so as to not stop the flow of ideas. This way, my peer and I could discuss the project even when not in the lab. As a result, our final design came out of a conversation we had while texting late at night. 

Another key aspect this project taught me was that a team can become so much more. During my free time, I took the initiative to have personal conversations with my peer. We eventually went to eat tacos with our families. Although not having anything to do with the project itself, this was by far the biggest step forward during the whole internship. Working along with a friend can make any project flow smoother and often leads to a better outcome. 

In the end, this project left me so much more than engineering experience. I was able to test firsthand the importance of communication and relationship building in any kind of environment. Not only did we successfully build the machine, but I consider myself a more complete and capable student.","My whole life I’ve dealt with failure. Failing to get into the High Schools I thought were right for me. More recently, failing to get into my dream school. Adversity has come my way in many shapes and forms. 

However, this same adversity has taught me so much more. I now embrace failure, learn from it, and quickly iterate to become better at whatever it is I’m doing. For an engineering team, this means I have the mindset to be prepared to fail small, just so I can improve and win even bigger. I believe in making mistakes, but more so in accepting them and becoming better because of it. 

An example of this happened during my internship. I was tasked with building a 3D model for the machine I was working on. Having no experience and a tight deadline ahead, I believed there was nothing I could do. Pressure built up more and more, but it was this pressure that took out the best in me. Within a couple of days I taught myself enough CAD to create a decent model. 

What I want to say is that I’m no stranger to failure, and this has made me a more analytical and confident person. I quickly learn from my mistakes, and am ten times more determined to complete a project. Coupling this with my many international experiences (living in the US and UK), as well as completing the IB diploma, I believe I can bring many new perspectives and experiences to the team.

In those times that I worked in a team, I would always make an effort to communicate with my teammates and help coordinate who does what and even out the workload. An example of this would be when I had to work with other people to complete an AP physics lab on a pulley system to measure the coefficient of friction for a certain object. There were many challenges in that lab because frankly I have never done anything that complex before, but I still tried to spread the workload evenly with all my teammates and tried to do my part well, which ended up producing great results in my humble opinion.There have also been times when my teammates were unavailable due to various reasons which shifted entire plans, so I’d have to communicate with other available teammates and discuss and a new plan. I have also been in positions where I was in a team but had no clue how anything worked like when I joined my high school basketball team. It was tragic since I knew nothing about the game, and the sport was a lot more competitive than I had originally thought, so I couldn’t do much as a player. Regardless, I tried to practice outside of the actual practices, and just tried to do what I could, like pass the ball to the more skilled player.","I believe that I am a valuable member because I am extremely eager to learn, and even though I will be inexperienced in the beginning, I feel like that will not be the case after a few weeks because I am willing to put in the work load. I will utilize my past experiences, and unlike the time I spent in my basketball team, I will grow indefinitely. Another thing I believe I am is a team player. I'm always willing to listen to my peers' ideas and perhaps find some way to incorporate it into the project, and if I feel like I'm way out of my league, I will always try to assist anyone who needs help them with hard labor or to hand them a wrench. I also would say that I am a resourceful person, and that I would always try to use what I already have unless it is absolutely necessary to buy something that is essential for the task at hand. And the last thing that I believe would make me a valuable member is that I have somewhat of a background experience in robotics and programming robots, albeit at a very basic level. So I won't be completely blind when I try to learn my way around.","I was the tennis captain in my junior year of high school, so that also contributed to my experience in working with a team.",,,

In the team setting, I have worked to efficiently divide tasks and research to maximize overall quality of work under time constraints. I work my best when brainstorming with team members and then having time for personal reflection to develop prototypes for the associated solutions. I also work better when under early set deadlines that can help map out a full season of work.","While I do have certified expertise in Fusion 360 and a few other programs, my strongest skill is to be able to apply fundamental creative problem solving to any system and quickly adapt to new problems and interfaces. This helps me rapidly iterate robustly engineered subsystems. Additionally, I am generally agreeable when it comes to changing ideas and taking criticism, but if I genuinely believe in my own process, I will stand by it.",,"I was planning on making the friday meeting, but some plans changed and I will be out of town from midday friday.",,

Boys State during the summer of 2023. The ultimate goal of the program was for participants to conduct the passing of mock legislation, which required rigorous team effort and compromise to improve dilapidated areas of D.C. Each member was elected into a position, such as myself, who served as Council Chairman of our committee (i.e. the official who oversaw meetings, ensured equal representation was given to all officers, and noted the allotted time for discourse). For example, our team struggled to pass legislation that ameliorated traffic control. Some of us disregarded the idea, stating that devoting time and funding to the project was unwarranted. However, we eventually came to a compromise in which additional funds were allocated to reconfiguring traffic light intervals. We ended the program having improved our ability to collaborate, especially in situations bordering impasse.
Additionally, I worked on a game design project during high school, where I was assigned group members and tasked with developing a game that would captivate the attention of the judges beyond the adversaries. My team and I spent months working on this project, and periodically contacted one other outside of school to develop the game further. Although there were some inconvenient struggles with work distribution and individual affairs, we overcame these difficulties and managed to place second by developing a game centered around defending oneself from zombified forces.","To be an effective team member is to strive for excellence, and I seek to perfect my grades and relevant knowledge while longing to step further and grasp information beyond the curriculum. Even when I fail to comprehend a particular subject, I work diligently to prevail by inquiring about the material and doing independent research. I stay prudent when making decisions that may inevitably veer my life, as one lost opportunity can dictate one’s success.
When working with subjects I fancy, such as those in STEM, I find myself working harder. I teach myself the fundamentals, such as computer logic and hardware, and allow experience to fill in the gaps. This has become apparent in the fields I’ve pursued; about a year ago, I interned at an auto repair shop which enlightened me on the basics of car repair and design, and did so with peers who primarily spoke Spanish. Despite the language barrier, I found myself far more captivated by its environment than through my lovely experiences in retail.
For an organization to be successful at promoting a cause and championing its way through heaps of competition, it takes members who embody the charisma and diligence of those who persist with purpose.  Hence why I would be a valuable member of your design teams. I reach out during times of struggle and implore others to do the same. I know to compromise with those around, even in times of frustration. And I personify hard work and inclusivity, which are imperative for team collaboration.",N/A,N/A,,

On these robots we use parts such as Rasberry Pis, pneumatic pistons, gearboxes, and custom built or printed parts. On my team, I shared and advocated for ideas, but was flexible and open for input, as well as accepting that my ideas were not always best for the team's goals. Although I am/was very flexible and amiable, I helped to set and enforce deadlines to make sure that we made necessary progress. When/if we failed to meet certain deadlines, I helped to make adjustments to our plans in order to keep making progress.

In addition to my robotics experience, I led an Eagle service project in which I developed plans for and led the building of wheeled garden beds for an assisted living facility. These garden beds were designed so that people in wheelchairs or with limited mobility and motor control could tend to a garden as an activity.","I led my high school's FRC robotics team for a year, managing approximately 40 students and adult mentors through a competitive build season and throughout the off season, as well as participating for 2 years before that. Throughout my time I had to build, manage, and maintain a schedule, learn effective management methods, and build conflict resolution skills. In addition to the leadership skills I have gained, I have had multiple years of experience on controls hardware and mechanical subgroups on the team, becoming the controls hardware team lead before taking the role as team FRC captain.

It’s beyond an initiative; it's a testament to my commitment to fostering a harmonious world. We’ve continued teaching these kids for 7 months now and through this opportunity, I've learned compassion, patience, and resilience, realizing that every person, regardless of his/her background or abilities, deserves the chance to recognise their potential and more. Virginia Tech's strong emphasis on community engagement and innovation provides the perfect environment for Chords Cure to flourish. As a musician and advocate of inclusivity, this journey has transformed me into a determined and empathetic individual.
","Participating in the Microsoft Imagine Cup is a huge opportunity for me to grow and contribute, even as someone with limited experience. I’m currently studying Computer Science, and while I’m early in my journey, I’m eager to apply my foundational knowledge and bring a fresh perspective to the design team. My strengths lie in problem-solving and creative thinking, which I believe are essential when tackling innovative projects like those in the Imagine Cup. I’m a fast learner, highly adaptable, and motivated to collaborate with more experienced team members to develop and refine ideas.

Our team was comprised of 5 members of our school’s Math Honor Society and ranged in experience from pre-calc all the way up to multi-variable calculus. I was the oldest member of the team, and the only senior, so I was given the role of team organizer. 

I got our team together for practice sessions trying to figure out major gaps in our knowledge and areas we should focus on. By the competition, I could designate problems based on everyone’s strengths since I was able to identify them earlier. This was the first time I had to take a bigger role in a group setting, so I made sure everyone felt ready going into the competition and like a contributing member to the team, no matter their level of math experience.  

While we didn’t place by the end of the event, we all had a good time; we learned how to solve Olympiad-type questions, collaborated under pressure, and grew familiar with each other. I feel this experience helped me understand the importance of a positive environment and the organization needed to work productively in a group, which I hopefully look forward to applying in Archimedes.","I’ve always believed that my strongest attribute was my curiosity. Since a young age, I’ve wanted to learn how things work, and I have adopted many hobbies to feed that desire. It’s also one of the reasons I’ve gravitated towards the sciences; they objectively describe the world around us. Whenever something didn’t make sense to me, I put in the extra effort to understand the underlying systems at play. 

This is especially true for math, where equations and theorems are introduced in school as “black boxes” and passed on with no further depth. There’s something unsettling to me about leaving big foundational concepts like that unexplained. If something piques my interest, curiosity fuels me to understand it intimately and keeps me going even if it’s something a little out of my depth. 

This trait will be valuable on a design team since there will undoubtedly be tasks and concepts that will be completely foreign to me. It’ll drive me to ask questions, seek out resources, and view different perspectives to build a solid understanding of the problem at hand. It compels me to get my hands dirty and confront the problem head-on, which I’m excited to bring to a collaborative environment on one of your design teams.",N/A,N/A,,

These activities required strong teamwork, as we often had to collaborate to manage different responsibilities and meet our goals effectively. My role typically involved coordinating between team members, sharing ideas, and supporting the overall team dynamic. I also worked on a team to create a Telecom Tariff Tracker project, where I was responsible for backend development using MySQL and Python. This required continuous communication and alignment with my teammates to ensure all components functioned seamlessly together. Whether it’s brainstorming solutions, managing tasks, or contributing technically, I enjoy taking on leadership when necessary while also valuing and supporting my teammates’ ideas and efforts.","I would bring a combination of strong technical skills, a commitment to collaboration, and a passion for problem-solving to the team. My experience working on projects such as the Computer Vision Text Scanner, where I used Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract, showcases my ability to design and implement solutions for complex challenges. In this project, I developed a system capable of extracting and interpreting text from images and documents, which required integrating multiple technologies and refining algorithms for accurate text recognition. This project not only demonstrated my technical skills but also my ability to tackle intricate problems and deliver practical solutions.

Moreover, my involvement in community service has strengthened my interpersonal and communication skills, making me comfortable working in diverse teams. I’m also an active learner who continuously seeks to improve my skills, whether it's through mastering new technologies or gaining hands-on experience in applying them. My versatility, combined with my technical expertise, would make me a valuable contributor to any design team, where I can offer fresh ideas and contribute effectively to collaborative problem-solving.",,,,

Within our group, I worked with other members to help create and edit our skits. I brainstormed what we would do for our skits, performed in a skit, and helped to edit the final products. I enjoyed getting to know the members in my group while working on the skits. We had some good laughs while acting, but we were able to get focused before long and continue. I liked that I was able to have a good time without losing sight of the end goal.

Another group project that I participated in was in my high school English class. This time, I was only in a group of four, and we were tasked with using a poster to argue whether food companies are responsible for the diets of the population. We decided to break up the team into having two “researchers” and two “artists”. Because I don’t have great handwriting, I was a researcher, and I used the provided articles and some background knowledge to put together an argument for our stance. I also decided how we would word our arguments on the poster. Essentially, I acted as an information gatherer and editor. This was nice because I got to use my strengths in developing arguments to meaningfully contribute to our poster. It was also good to be able to support the artists with words of encouragement while they were writing and drawing.","I would be a valuable member to a design team because I am a problem-solver, have perseverance, and am a team player.

The main reason that I love programming so much is because it is almost all problem-solving. When I see a problem, it’s natural for me to think of as many potential solutions as I can. I use this skill not only for myself, but also to help others. For example, I always try to help someone with technological issues since that is a strength of mine. Being able to problem-solve will prove useful in the design teams because problems will arise and need fixing.

Perseverance is another trait I have. When I am struggling with a problem, I keep pushing. My pride won’t let me give up on a task when I’m having some trouble. Last year, I wanted to create an equation on my calculator to calculate my balance if I periodically put a certain amount of money into an investment account. I ran into a lot of trouble, but after almost two hours, I finally figured out a solution, and I still use it today. Perseverance is valuable for members of a design team because nothing will get done if the members give up easily.

Lastly, I’m a team player. I was the president of the Esports club at my high school and worked with everyone to gauge their skill and coach them. We had about nine active members, and I got to know them and pinpoint what they each needed help with. Being aware of your team and their strengths and weaknesses is an important part of participating in a design team.","While computer science is the engineering discipline that reflects my talents the best, I am more than willing to learn more about topics related to other disciplines as well. I just want to be as useful as I can to my team. I'm also excited to potentially be able to use actual programming for more than just a hobby. Finally, I'm glad to have the opportunity to apply for this program. The fact that I know that everyone on the design teams are first-years like me really helps me to feel more at ease.",,,

On this committee my role was to communicate with the 8 professional chefs working the event and relay their menu item descriptions and ingredient needs to the team and event staff. I also helped organize a 200+ person seating chart. I believe I functioned well in this setting. Because this was not my foundation, I played more of a follower role and ensured everything asked of me was completed on time and in an organized manner. However, I was not shy to taking a leadership role when it became necessary. Overall, the event was very successful, and I was asked back as the event's videographer/documenter at the next A Meal for Amiel fundraising dinner. 

AP Seminar Group Presentation: As a sophomore I enrolled in AP Seminar. Our first AP graded assignment was a randomly assigned group presentation. Going into the project I only knew one of my team members. However, over the weeks we grew to know each other's strengths and weaknesses as well as divided the work. I took an organization and mediative role in this team. I kept us on task during work periods, on schedule for our final presentation, and mediated any disagreements within the group. Overall, I believe I worked well in this team being that the College Board scored our presentation a 4/5.","My time as Class President and Executive President of my high school's student government system developed my communication, organizational, and time management skills. My experience as Garde Manager and Expeditor at the Lake Hopatcong Yacht Club improved my adaptability in a face paced environment as well as honed my attention to detail. And because of these experiences, as well as the group projects listed above, I believe I would be a valuable asset on any of the Archimedes teams. 
I believe the skills I've developed through my personal and professional experiences alongside my intelligence and work ethic will greatly benefit the team's efficiency and success.

It fit the requirements for effective CPR, and it was meant to be carried by a person with heart problems so that any bystander could safely administer CPR without any prior knowledge. I also participated in designing a model of a more energy-efficient HVAC system, which used an electric bike alternator and a fan inside the system to reuse wasted energy and channel it back into other parts of the building. In a team setting, I generally take any role that I am needed in, which, in the case of the HVAC system design group, involved taking on smaller tasks involving the construction of the model. I am generally very flexible and adaptable in group settings like these. Most of the time, however, like with the chest compressor design group, I am needed in the leadership role, so I lead the team if no one else is willing to step up. On the chest compression team, I checked up on all my teammates and assigned roles, making sure we met the deadline for each task. I was very good at organizing and planning for each component of the mechanism. I also feel very guilty if I feel as though I drag the team down, so I always prioritize group work and hold people accountable when they don’t meet their own deadlines without reason, but I am always willing to adapt to people’s situations and circumstances.","I was particularly interested in the Juvo team since it involved designing devices meant for people with disabilities. When anyone asks me why I chose to study engineering, my answer is always that as a Christian, my vocation is to serve, and I believe that engineering is the best way that I can utilize my skills to serve others. In other words, I am passionate and determined to help others. I could also say that I am a good problem-solver, but dedication is what brings goals to completion and what turns ideas into products that help people. There are many engineers that have created products that showcase their complete misunderstanding of the people they are selling their ideas to.

The board was divided into subsections, and I led the section that put together workshops for the science section of the ACT. Our group worked to put together slides and worksheets while I coordinated the logistics of the event. 

In general I tend to take a leadership role in a team because I am usually one of the most motivated to take initiative and deal with the logistics of a project. However, I am also happy to be delegated tasks and focus on the details rather than the big picture of the project. No matter what position I hold in a team, I’m always excited to collaborate with others—I love being able to rely on others in the face of my weaknesses while bringing unique strengths to the table. Being able to create a beautiful finished product built on a kaleidoscope of individual contributions is my favorite part of teamwork, and I hope to participate in such a group on one of the Archimedes design teams.
","While I do have some technical skills such as experience with python, I would say the main strengths I bring to the table are soft skills. In high school, I was a tutor in our Writing Center and helped people with college essays, scientific papers, and a myriad of other writing assignments. I love bridging the gap between technical information and a broader audience interested in the ramifications of said research—both in writing and in oral presentation.

Learning is another thing I love to do—I’m always motivated to research and make connections between what I do and don’t know. I know I have a lot to learn, both technical and soft skill wise, but I can’t wait to delve into new topics while gleaning knowledge from hands-on experience.

I also have extensive leadership experience, not only with the projects I previously mentioned, but also as the captain of my school’s color guard team for 2 years. There I learned to deal with intra-team tensions, as well as coordinating with the school, the band directors, and my coach. I was also disillusioned with the title of a leader—it’s a buzzword people like to throw around, but I quickly realized it meant being the first to arrive and the last to leave. Leadership is where I learned dedication and discipline and determination—all personal skills I want to use for the benefit of yet another team. 
","I'm not sure if any of the competitions have age restrictions, but I am a minor (17) and will be until June, I'm hoping that's not a problem. ",N/A,,

My most notable project would have to be the robotics project I had to create for one of my robotics courses. I was in a group with two other girls, and I was nominated team leader for the group. Our big project for the course was to design and build a disability aid robot, so I proposed that we build a robotic cane for the blind. I designed the blueprint for the robot, and by using Vex robotics equipment, the cane would utilize ultrasonic sensors to detect walls and be powered by wheels to guide the blind. This was made possible with the RobotC coding language. In the team setting, I instructed my team members on how we would build the robot and researched the necessary equipment. I also researched how to code the robot and got its wheels to move forward by pressing a button on the cane, as well as got its ultrasonic sensors to detect objects. In addition to robotics teams, I have worked with teams in my app development class. For our big project, we had to design an app that implemented research from lower classmen about the culture of various countries. The countries would be presented on a map, and the user would be able to click a country and learn information about it based on the research. I was mainly responsible for the front end of the app, designing the layout of the information sections and implementing the research that was conducted previously. ","From my experience in working with teams, I have learned that initiative is the key to making anything possible. Sometimes, a team will hit a roadblock in the engineering process, which can be discouraging, however, a team member who is there to give a little push or motivation can help get the team back on track. My goal is to serve as this kind of team member so the team is enthusiastic in reaching the end goal, despite the challenges we face along the way. In addition, I have developed a variety of skills that would be beneficial to the design team, such as programming skills, design skills, like sketching and outlining, communication skills, and balancing skills to ensure each team member gets to do their part. ","I am interested in pursuing computer science as a major during my time at Virginia Tech, and being apart of a design team will definitely help improve my abilities in coding, collaboration, and problem solving. I have always wanted to sharpen these skills so I can work effectively in future team settings and build fun but challenging projects. I would also like to meet new friends and create memories while being apart of the design team. Thank you very much for your consideration.",N/A,,

I was also involved in many more academic and community projects back in high school. Most of the time I confidently stood out to be the leader. I managed the team's work, meetings, and progress... I sometimes resolved arguments between team members. I am confident that I am a very responsible and serious person in working and studying. I learn very quick, and can handle a big load of work without any stress. I enjoy working in a team environment, and I can get along well with people.

Therefore, I believe that with my desire to learn and work in teams, I will do my best to contribute to the team, complete my tasks, and help others. Moreover, I have competed in a hackathon in high school, which also related to applying AI in solving a global problem.

At first I didn’t like this because I’d rather just work with my friends in the class. However, it taught me how to work with different types of people since some individuals were very quiet and wanted me to carry the conversations while others felt the need to be in control.  I learned to change the way I work based on who I’m working with so we can produce the best results.
 The biggest team settings I have experienced are on high school sports teams, volleyball in particular.  In volleyball there is a lot of communication and adjustment since the perfect set for someone else could be a horrible set for me.  After some plays it is necessary to give feedback to your setter so he can adjust which allows us as a team to produce the best product we can.  This constant back and forth of constructive criticism has taught me alot about how to respectfully work with others to solve a problem.  
","	I would be a valuable member of one of the Archimedes design teams because I work well in a group since I am able to take the lead in projects as well as take a back seat to someone else.  Also, when I set my mind to a project I become hyper focused on it and will work as long as needed to see it through until the end.  I have played sports all of my life so I know what it means to be a part of a team and all of the different components that allow a team to function smoothly and effectively.  I am currently not a part of any student organizations on campus and believe Archimedes would be a valuable learning experience and something I’d be able to dedicate real time towards.  I am majoring in mechanical engineering so Archimedes would allow me to gain the technical skills that I currently lack and then be able to apply them to a real world problem.  ",No,N/A,,

While not a “project” in the literal sense, it’s a group working together to accomplish a common goal, just like a typical design team would do.  While on my team for three years, I learned a lot about working in a team setting.  I functioned both as a leader and follower during my experience, and I think good leaders should switch between both.  As a follower, I learned from upperclassmen and other teammates about new moves, alignments, and adjustments.  As a leader, I applied this knowledge to my game, becoming a better football player and leading by example.  Furthermore, I taught other teammates what I knew and what I had learned, bettering the whole team as a result.

Since a football team is so big, I could not directly lead each of my teammates as a team leader on a design team would.  More similar to the design teams in Archimedes, a group of 4 people from my engineering class and I built a drill holder for our design lab.  I took a leadership role and used my sketching and CAD skills to plan and design a 3D model with accurate dimensions and a bill of materials.  After the planning phase, I continued to lead my team by managing materials while also being a follower and learning more about power tools.  Similar to my football team, I learned from my teammates while still having a leadership role, thus improving my leadership and the team at the same time.
","I feel I have acquired a lot of skills that would make me a valuable member of one of the Archimedes design teams.  I have taken a lot of engineering classes throughout high school that have developed my hard and soft skills greatly.

One of my best skills is computer-aided design.  I have seven SOLIDWORKS certifications including the CSWP(Certified SOLIDWORKS Professional), which is the third most difficult certification.  A few of the other certifications include categories such as drawing tools and additive manufacturing.  I earned all of these certifications during my first two years of high school, and had I taken a different path I may have earned even more.

What stopped me from earning more certifications was being part of the international baccalaureate program.  This program allowed me to take HL Design Technology, a higher-level advanced course for engineering focused on creating projects rather than taking exams.  Thus, I continued to improve my CAD skills while also improving my teamwork and leadership skills.  I also learned how to develop my CAD models into physical products, which led to me creating a plethora of projects.  Some of these projects include a 3D-printed doorstop with ABS and acrylic paint, a wooden door hanging using a CNC router, and a wooden inlay using a laser cutter and wood stain.

Overall my high school engineering experience has given me the skills to succeed on a college design team, even as a freshman.
","-The IB HL design technology class mentioned above is a two year class.  In the four total semseters I was in that class I recieved an A each time.
-Overal my weighted highschool GPA was 4.7
-I did not choose three of the design teams just to improve my chances of getting in, but rather because im interested in each of the individual design teams themselves and their objectives.",,,

My work in the programming role was also strongly supported by my group members in research roles who explored current methods of occupancy detection with sensors. This prior literature review helped us form our research question as a group. Throughout the process, I encouraged participation, and communicated my progress regularly with my mentor for guidance. This experience enhanced my importance of communication and leadership when working with others. In this nurturing environment, I enhanced my skills in Python, and published an abstract. I still talk to my grad-student mentor and I even wrote a full research paper for my AP research class. I took away so much from this group project. 

Over the summer, I participated in a program at Virginia Tech called C-Tech2 where my group worked on a design project. Through this, I realized my knack for evolution. I revamped our group’s idea for an alarm bracelet by turning it into an original and marketable product.  As a leader, I managed the technical aspects and built the device.

Prior to senior year, I had worked on numerous projects with different teams to solve a range of problems, but my capstone project was taken to another level. My partner and I could choose any problem we wanted to tackle, and shooting for the stars we decided to develop something to combat climate change. Long story short, we found that styrofoam and the food industry both have significant, negative impacts on the environment, so we designed a biodegradable raw meat tray. This tray was uniquely shaped so that it could collect meat juices without the need of an absorbent pad, making it 100% Earth friendly. Our mentor, an engineer from Gore, helped us navigate the design process in a way that mirrored that of a professional engineer.
Supported by my years of teamwork experience and the fact that my capstone team won first place at the design fair (presenting to engineers and other adults in our community), I would say I thrive in a team setting. I am organized, industrious, and simply enjoy collaborating with others, especially when we all bring unique perspectives and ideas to the table. I am naturally more of a leader than a follower, which I say because of my tendency to ensure my team is on track rather than a desire to be in charge.

As Head Girl of my high school, I led a student body of 150, managing and coordinating intra-school and inter-school events, including cultural fests, athletic meets, and academic competitions. This role refined my leadership and organizational abilities, emphasizing clear communication and teamwork.
As a core member of the Editorial Committee from 2022 to 2024, I was involved in designing, editing, and drafting the annual school magazine. Collaborating with fellow members and faculty, I contributed to brainstorming, drafting, and coordinating with the design team, learning the value of diverse perspectives and creativity in teamwork.
My participation in the Rotary Interact Club from 2022 to 2023 allowed me to engage in community service, including organizing food and supply drives for blind schools, orphanages, and hosting the annual fundraiser, ‘Expressions’.  I learned how to plan and execute community outreach projects and positively impact society.
In all these roles, I focused on active listening, contribution, and peer support. Balancing various responsibilities while maintaining academic performance, I dedicated myself to teamwork and success. My experiences have equipped me with skills in leadership, communication, organization, and project management, which are vital for thriving in a team setting.","While I may not have technical expertise, my strengths in public speaking, leadership, teamwork, time management, and communication make me a valuable addition to Infinitum. My past roles involved effective collaboration, managing teams and ensuring clear communication among peers and faculty members. Consequently, these experiences fostered a deep appreciation for teamwork and group dynamics in my life. 
Public speaking has been a key part of my life. I graduated high school as class valedictorian, and am proficient at debating too. I would love to focus on time management, organization, and ensuring everyone’s ideas are explored as a team at Archimedes.
When I encountered Archimedes at the O Show, I had the chance to meet Aryaman and Indu. As we had the most random but intriguing conversation about Indian weddings, I felt an immediate sense of belonging. Being away from home is not easy, and they made me feel at home in an instant. I look forward to contributing to Archimedes, being part of a strong community, and helping develop an app that benefits society.
Although I am currently learning Python and have experience in Java, my true strength lies in my ability to work well within a team. I am excited about the opportunity to join Archimedes, learn and develop new skills, network, and contribute to Infinitum. Being a part of your team would be an honor, and I am confident that my experiences, dedication and commitment would make me a valuable member of your team.

The two best group projects I remember working on was making a functional home lab with remote access and a website for the club. The home lab took place over the course of two hours. The entire club got together, and after getting divided into four groups, we each took a server and configured it to the right IP address and other servers in the room. Before this, however, a host server was set up to be the main hub. Through teamwork, everyone decided what went where when it came to plugging in wires, what software we needed (ex: PROXMOX), and how we would approach the activity. The website project was more personal as there was around 6 people who actively worked on it. Over the course of a few months, we built up a website from scratch. None of us had any experience with HTML before, so we viewed it as a success. Each person was either on team HTML or CSS. However, this did not matter as any person could do what they wanted with permission. We all searched the internet and asked each other for tips and tricks on how to make the website more functional or better looking. Through this sharing of ideas, we managed to create a product using tools which we never utilized before. Essentially, in both projects, I functioned in a team setting through sharing my unique ideas or asking others for help to make sure we all succeed in the end. ","I see myself as a person who is willing to work for as long as necessary to get to the end goal. No matter if we are 90% done or 10% done, I will stay with something until it is complete. This also means that I am willing to put an infinite amount of time into something even if it does not require that much attention. I enjoy working on projects for this reason as I can create something which not only represents my interests, but the interests of the team I am on. Additionally, I love to meet and work with others, so I see the design teams being a great opportunity to connect and make new friends. While I lack much experience regarding engineering teams as I have never really wanted to do engineering until a few years ago, I hope to use this as a chance to expand my skillset while reminding myself as to why I love engineering. The two design teams which I have applied to are Terra and Astra. The reason I did not select Juvo or Infinitum is because they do not allign with my interests, and I feel that I can put more time and true dedication towards a project if I am invested with its mission. Astra and Terra both focus on topics which I have been interested in for years but never made the move to try and do something. My main hesitation stems from fear, but now that I am attending University, I feel it is time to stop being scared to try new things. As people say, ""the best time to start was yesterday, but the second best time is now.""

In the first project, my group was tasked with designing and prototyping an under-the-elbow prosthetic. This process required lots of research and technical writing, with our final paper being around 30 pages in length. My role in the group was mostly designing on Autodesk Inventor/Fusion 260 and working on the final paper. The second major and most involved project was my participation in the NASA HUNCH competition. NASA HUNCH is a competition where NASA gives high school students a chance to design and build products for the ISS. My group of 4 decided to build a soft-robotic arm for a vacuum robot that would clean the ISS. Since it needed to be a soft-robotic arm, we opted for a pneumatically powered silicone robber arm. This arm was able to extend, twist, and grab onto the ISS handrails, allowing the vacuums robot to maneuver around the station. Since it was a small group and only 2 of us had some sort of ""engineering"" experience, I was involved in all aspects of the project, especially designing and fabricating the claw portion of the arm. Our arm ended up winning the regional competition and Langley, and we flew to Houston, Texas to present it to NASA Engineers and the general public and the Johnson Space Center. ","With previous experience in engineering related projects and especially the NASA HUNCH competition, I believe I would be a valuable and reliable member of a design team given that I had to go through the process before in the past. I have experienced the amount of time these kinds of projects take, and have had to find the persistence and discipline in overcoming last minute trials to make a working product, while balancing other aspects of life. Besides competition experience, my journey in Boy Scouts to become an Eagle Scout has taught me social and leadership skills that I believe would benefit a group that has to go through the occasional tense moments that naturally come with these kinds of projects.",,,,

In my 8th grade robotics class, I was in a team where we had to design a robot to aid someone with a disability. I gained some experience from that, but it was cut short by COVID. Generally, I believe I’m best suited as a dedicated member who has the team’s best interests in mind rather than the leader of a team (although I take initiative when necessary). I try to be someone my teammates can depend on if they need help, like doing a certain section of the project or even something completely unrelated. I try to fill in the gaps so our team functions in the best way possible.","I haven’t been in a long running project like any of the Archimedes teams, but I believe my abilities in a team setting still transfer over. I see the value in not just hearing but also uplifting my teammates’ voices. They always help you see an angle to the problem that you wouldn’t see if you were alone. This is why I always strive to be a listener and make sure everyone is heard. Another thing I try to do is maintain accountability. In a team everyone has to pitch in to achieve our goal. I hold myself accountable and hold up my end so I don’t let my team down. That being said, sometimes you need help. There are a lot of reasons why someone could be struggling; it could be project-related or something personal. This is why it’s important to have empathy. I always strive to have empathy for my teammates, and lift them up when they’re down. Another thing I try to do is bond with my teammates, so we can create an environment where everyone sees each other as not just colleagues but friends. Sure, the overarching goal is the project but getting to know one another means we can understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses better. As a member of one of the Archimedes design teams, I will always strive to bring forth these qualities.","Nothing I can think of right now, thank you!",,,

I believe that I functioned decently in a team setting as I came to meetings nearly every day and was willing to spend extra time to ensure certain things got done. However, my biggest regret was not speaking up and learning enough. That year, all I did was listen to the team captains and complete objectives based on what they had said. For example, when the building team captain assigned me to the task of scrapping the previous year’s robot for spare tools, I ended up getting it done. However, I did not ask many questions about the robot, the game, or the engineering process either. In other words, I did not learn very much. As such, since I did not display my interest, the captains did not seem interested in advising me on how to become a better engineer. I rejoined the team the next year because I wanted to give it another shot, and it was worth it. I started small by talking to my peers more and making sure we were all on the same page while working. For example, when the arms of the robot, a pivotal part required for the 2023 game, were not extending properly, I conversed with the rest of the group to come up with a solution. I made sure to write down the steps we needed to cover and how we could solve each one within the larger problem. I believe that my speaking up encouraged some of my fellow students to engage proactively as well, and we made it further than we did previously. ","	I would be a valuable member for one of the design teams because I am willing to put in extra time to ensure things get done. For example, during my part-time job at Mathnasium, I was willing to stay half an hour to an hour after closing time four days a week to ensure that the center was clean and ready for students to learn the next day. Similarly, I am a devoted and fast learner. For the infinitum team, I understand that even though I may possess one or two skills that I may need for projects that the team will work on, I will most definitely, if selected, need to learn many new skills. I believe that my devotion to learning will help me learn these skills. For example, for an assignment last year, I had to learn Python, so I learned it within a couple of days and applied it to the project. Additionally, I believe that I have incredible communication skills. As stated, my communication skills haven’t always been good, but I have improved to a point where I can communicate excellently in a team. I used these skills while I was the Math Instructor Captain at Mathnasium, where I led the math instruction team and communicated with my coworkers efficiently to ensure the team was working productively and was effectively teaching. I am also willing to compromise on certain ideas. I understand that members may have different views on how to implement a certain idea, and, in that scenario, I would revert to paper and make a pros and cons chart for each idea to create a solution.","	I understand from the interest meetings that, for Infinitum, it is okay if the applicants are not people who are extremely talented at coding or computer science. I do intend to be a computer science major here at Virginia Tech, but I feel as though I need to practice more and discuss with more people regarding computer science technologies. I am very eager to gain any experience I can whatsoever, and I believe that this would be the perfect opportunity for me if I am selected. I would sincerely like to join this design team because I want to gain experience with different technologies and tying everything together. I can do one or two things, but I have a hard time tying things together and building something. Even now, I consider myself more of a thinker and not an engineer because I am not very good at engineering. However, I would sincerely like to improve my skills and actually make something as part of a team. I believe that this design team can help me gain experience, and I would love to help other people who kind of feel stuck as I do right now, in the future. ",,,

One of the group projects I was involved in was my high school's FIRST robotics team. This robotics team involved many different sub teams who had to work together in order for the robot to be built correctly and in a timely manner for competitions. This meant communication was crucial both between sub teams and within the sub teams themselves. As I was part of the sub team who helped to build the frame and structure of the robot, I learned to communicate with my teammates what exactly should be done in a day and how we should go about it. With other sub teams, such as programming, when we needed the robot to make adjustments and when the robot would be ready to test. Additionally, if the other sub teams needed assistance getting projects done before their deadlines, I was able to step in and help them. On multiple occasions when the build team did not have much work to be done, I would step in and assist the media and admin team, which often involved helping to book hotel and restaurant reservations, as well as contacting donors and local companies for sponsorships. Since everyone on our team communicated well with each other and collectively work to improve our team and our chances of succeeding, every person on the team respected each other and became genuine friends by the end of the season. This experience allowed me to improve my ability to work in a team and contribute towards success. 
","Many of my skills would make me a valuable member to any of the design teams. Not only do I have success working as a team in high school robotics, working a fast food job, and on my high school and travel softball team, I have learned valuable teamworking skills from each of these teams. I have learned to communicate clearly with other team members, as well as help other team members when they are struggling. Similarly, whenever I have tasks I need to accomplish or need help finishing certain tasks, I make sure to communicate this with my team. When given an assignment or a goal to reach, I will work towards it extremely hard, often giving large portions of my time to ensure the task is completed to the best of my ability. Additionally, I am typically an outside-of-the-box thinker, which allows me to come up with unique and unusual ideas for solving problems. I believe my ability to work well with others, communicate and shares my ideas and opinions, generate new ideas for the team, and my ability to work hard would make me a valuable member to any of the design teams.

In my sophomore year I co-founded our schools robotics team, which surprisingly did not exist in a school with over 2,000 students. This team went on to podium both my junior and senior year, narrowly missing a spot at world stage. Our team consisted of roughly 10 members, with each having a specific role or set of skills. This team worked out of our friends garage , and spent many late nights building under the light of phones and lamps to make it to our state championship, personally I documented our progress in our engineering journal, and specialized in drivetrain and lift mechanics. On the other side of the coin I led group efforts within the Slavic Support Group, a group dedicated to helping Slavic refugees both Russian and Ukrainian. Our primary goal was to plan event for broken families and newcomers. My team among others, planned and executed various games for the children, while providing food and connection for the parents and families who were in need of a community. I could not bring families and a community together on my own. I could not have founded the robotics team or even built a robot without the help of many friends and teammates. Each situation we come across in life can only be benefited by inclusion and a group effort, because even if we could do it alone, we surely can do better as a team.  ","I do have previous technical experience which of course helps, but mostly I'm excited to be in each part of the process, even if I am not accepted, learning about Archimedes has been a great time for me. Knowing that a group dedicated to given freshman a greater role is super cool. I am eager to earn my place in Archimedes, and although spots are limited, I think that my enthusiasm, prior knowledge, and initiative are three incredibly important things to consider. It is exactly the kind of organization that could benefit from someone who loves to learn, and more importantly lead. In the past I have helped others, and now I want to put this energy into something that I truly believe in. Archimedes does something quite genius, because if you want to join, you really need to want to do it. Anyone can join Baja and work on little things, and put it down on their resume. Freshman who really want to work and learn, they are the ones who join clubs like Archimedes. ","This club is amazing, I've heard about it before I came to tech and it has always been my intention to join it. What the club does is unique and I applaud it, even if I am declined, know that what Archimedes does is spectacular.",I attended a meeting,,

My greatest group projects were all extra curricular. For about 8 years, I competed in robotics (FTC). Robotics is a group activity and was extremely valuable for my development in a group environment. In the beginning, it taught me how to work collaboratively with others, divide work, and use everyone else's strengths to the group's greatest benefit. As I grew older, I gained leadership experience within the robotics team as I was one of the oldest and experience members. As a leader, I learned how to identify other's strengths and encourage them to excel. Another group project was much more recent. During this last summer, I worked with 2 other friends to develop an app to comparatively track grocery prices. This project was much more difficult than robotics because the goal was much more abstract, and the result was much less certain. This project was much more collaborative and had significantly less divide and conquer due to the amount of people.

In these team functions, I felt as though I flourished. Working solo is fun, but working in a group is significantly better. The wide variety of opinions, points of view, and solutions you can get makes whatever product you may be developing much better. I think I work very well in a group context because of the major benefit of having multiple brains work on a problem.","I believe I would be a valuable member of one of your design teams because of my passion for STEM. A majority of my previous group and solo projects have been on the stem side and correlate with the goals of the Archimedes' design teams. For my high school senior year engineering project, I designed a pencil grip that allowed people with mobility issues and arthritis to write pain free which aligns with the goals of Juvo. As I stated earlier, I have always been obsessed with robotics which brings along experience in microcontrollers, CAD, and assembling. Even one of my first jobs was as a robotics instructor for young kids around my maker space. Another project I have worked on was a video game controller made for people with repetitive motion issues in their hands. For this project, I had to learn how to design circuit boards and work with circuit board manufacturers. I remember doing small model rockets as well when I was in middle school and early high school as well.

Ever since I was a kid I have always loved creating some of my first memories were spent in my garage trying to make super Nerf guns. I've grown up surrounded by STEM and I would love to express this passion to an even greater degree with people who feel the same in college. Having another reason to create, innovate, and try to improve the world would be amazing during the busy college life. I would also love to eventually work with Archimedes to recruit the new incoming freshmen.","I am certified in Autodesk Inventor, Python, and I have experience in most shop tools due to working in a makerspace.

That was a very disappointing experience, but I learned to read the fine print. Currently, my friend and I are working on a website where we will sell products related to college admissions such as an algorithm to pick schools, application data, etc. to prospective students. He has no programming knowledge, so I have to communicate all tech things without jargon. It can be challenging, but I think that sort of communication is very valuable to practice.

The project’s main goal was to spark change into our community giving representation for highschoolers in local school politics. Our group’s goal was to bridge that gap of communication and to help highlight to these committee members what are the students’ needs and worries. We had a group of ten people and our school librarian acting as a guide. Our student led organization was dynamic and influential to people in the community as we hosted community dialogues in the schools, attended local conferences held by our school board. and research organizations that could help our school atmosphere where mental health was a huge worry across the student body. We had five groups of two students that would take on each section of student’s wellbeing, basing our group off Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. I oversaw the loving and belonging of students where I collaborate and help provide information to the rest of the group about what the students in our school needed. When I was overwhelmed with reviewing note at each dialogue, the group would always help me review over the conversations made that day. We all work together in unison to make this committee amazing because we all believed in this organization to spark change in our school system. The journey for me is amazing because I learn that the group will always support me and how as a group, we could create something amazing for our community.","	Whenever I face a problem, I always go full speed ahead learning as I go. I feel it’s the best way for me to tackle problems because it helps me create a foundation in what need to worry about in each obstacle I face. A perfect example of this was in summer robotic class I took where I learn how to control Sphero with basic coding. I love coding in sections to help check myself that the Sphero code was working properly, but this created funny situations where my code would have my bot do funny movements like a 360-barrel roll. It was embarrassing when my code wasn’t working properly, but I always loved it when these scenarios happen because it would always bring a light-hearted charm to the room. This is why I love and strive to be an optimistic person that does their best to help others because I know how stressful these projects can end up being, especially in crunch time. Failure and mistakes are bound to happen, but it’s equally important to bounce back and become stronger with the newfound knowledge. Which is why I want to be a part of this community, so I can be the support that each of my teammates needs as we work late hours in putting these projects together! I love working in the community and when I saw how tight-knit you all were in the introductory meeting, I knew I wanted to be a part of Archimedes. I feel that I can be my strongest when there are people around me that help match my drive to a goal and when people are relying on me to perform well. ","I don't know too much about coding, using CAD, or the advance levels of becoming an engineer, but I love giving it my all to become a better version of myself, so when it comes down to it in using these kinds of programs, I'll take every opportunity I can to help learn and grow so that I can reach the standard that each design team needs.",,,

I was chair of the snowball dance committee so I helped plan and organize both the event and our team to produce a successful dance. My other responsibilities included ordering the dance materials, contacting multiple members of my school to organize the event, and assisting my team members whenever necessary. Although I was chair of the event, I made sure to never make final decisions without my team members’ input. I made sure all my team members were both seen and heard as well as made sure all of their ideas were taken into account. Besides being chair of an event, I also gained lots of experience working as a committee member. For those committees, I mainly stuck to doing the job I was assigned, but I also assisted my other team members when possible. Once again, I made sure to maintain a team oriented structure on every committee I worked on. Along with student council, I was a head editor for my school’s broadcast journalism club in my sophomore and junior year. Every three weeks I was assigned a new group of three to four students who would help me film and edit a news segment that was released to the student body. Here I was able to teach my group various videography and editing skills as well as interviewing tips. I collaborated with my group members often and would try filming any ideas they came up with.","I would be a valuable member to one of the design teams because I have experience in the tech industry and computer science knowledge. I held an internship with Lockheed Martin from June 2023 to August 2024 where I worked as a full stack software engineer. During my internship, I developed a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this experience I have become highly proficient in HTML and CSS as well as gained beginner knowledge in JavaScript. I also had multiple experiences presenting my projects to senior level employees. I learned how to pitch my products and how to successfully present information in a digestible manner. I also gained experience working with both the other interns and senior employees on a team to produce a product while meeting tight deadlines. During my junior year of high school, I was the captain of a python coding club. This was a 6 week intensive coding club where I both learned python and taught it to my group of peers. This experience gave me a medium proficiency in python. On top of this, I learned how to digest a coding language fast and utilize my skills in a competition setting. I am adaptable and will quickly pick up knowledge of both potential coding languages and other areas of expertise I may need to know for the design teams. I am willing and excited to learn whatever I need to be taught in order to contribute effectively to a team while developing my skills.",,,,

Another group project I participated in was my high schools First Robotics Team, where I was the team captain. As the captain I attempted to guide the design process in a way where everybody was able to collaborate and influence the final design. During the build process I attempted to take advantage of team members skills by assigning them to appropriate tasks.","I believe my problem-solving and leadership talents would make me a valuable design team member. On a design team I would be able to use my skills in programming, CAD, and fabrication. I am able to break down large undertakings into smaller tasks while still maintaining a view on the entire projects, a skill which I think is useful for a design team.

Scared doesn’t begin to describe how I felt during our first meeting! Although this club was my brainchild, I had no prior experience with this type of work. This was my first taste of hands-on collaboration. I wanted to make this enjoyable for club members, but I was scared my own inexperience might come in the way of this.

Luckily, I learned by doing. Whether STEM Club members were designing their own prosthetic legs, building their own mini-rockets, or designing props for school events, all club members learned how to navigate working in a team setting. Personally, I believe I gained invaluable skills that year: the ability to communicate my ideas, to speak to large groups of people, and to match my strengths to different tasks within a project. I didn’t just learn how to work in a team, I thrived while doing so, ultimately helping my teams create quality products.

On Archimedes, I have no doubt that the lessons I learned during this experience will translate seamlessly to my work on one of the teams. I hope (and believe I will be) an effective team member!","During high school, I fostered the virtue of helping others through my extracurriculars. I founded my school’s STEM Club to give fellow students a fun way to explore science and math concepts; I worked as a Mathnasium instructor to give K-12 kids digestible approaches to math; and I participated in many volunteer projects as a National Honor Society member. I am confident that this passion will carry me through the work at Archimedes. It will push me to persevere through the inevitable failures, tribulations, and frustration that may come my team’s way, knowing that my work can potentially help companies and/or change the lives of others.","I have approximately a year and a half’s experience with Python.

We were modeling off of the idea of the Baltimore Kinetic Sculpture race that happens every year. Each group had to develop an idea, a team banner, a rubber band-powered car design, a “sculpture” design for their car, and a team costume. In the group, I was able to function very cohesively and was designated as the team organizer. I helped delegate the tasks we needed to complete, recorded our progress each day, and helped communicate ideas within the group. Through this process, our group was able to effectively get everything we needed completed as we split up to manage each task. Even though we had split the tasks, we each played a role in communicating to ensure cohesiveness throughout our project, this way our final product was a culmination of our ideas together. Including my role in the group, I also had to teach myself new skills to complete our project, such as using a sewing machine to make our team costume. No one in our group knew how to sew but I was willing to step up and attempt it. By taking extra time and helpful instruction from my teacher, I was able to eventually effectively use the sewing machine and manufacture our team costume. Overall, when being on the team, I felt I was able to effectively contribute to my group by stepping up and taking on what needed to be done. ","As a potential team member, I believe that the set of skills and energy that I bring to the table are all reasons I could become a valuable member. As far as team skills, I am an excellent communicator and listener. I am willing to take the time to listen to others and effectively take in others’ ideas. I believe that as a group, everyone’s input is important when coming up with an idea for a project. I am a quick learner and am willing to take the time to get to know what it is that I need to learn to accomplish a task. Especially with this being a first-year design team, I feel that it’s important to be willing to take time inside and outside of meetings to help the team effectively. When I put my mind to doing something I ensure that I will take it and go as far as I can with it to better myself. Lastly, as a member of the design team, I feel it's important to have good energy on the team. As a member, I am ready to bring excitement with me. Excited to learn about new skills and get to be a part of a creative effort as a team. I am positive that all these facets of my personality will make me a valuable member of the design team for Archimedes.",In previous years I have been involved in VEX robotics teams in high school and have done summer programs revolving around robotics engineering. ,,,

I like working with other people because it is always so interesting to see what they bring to the table and learn new skills from them. ","I have a lot of coding experience. I’ve done a ton of independent projects using languages like Python, Javascript (HTML,CSS), and microcontrollers and microprocessors like Arduino and Raspberry Pis. I also have a lot of experience working on a budget. When I was doing robotics with my school they didn’t see as much value in the robotics program so our equipment was much more outdated than the other schools, but we made it work and still ended up placing better than a lot of the schools with updated equipment. In addition, when I was doing my independent projects I was much more inexperienced so I didn’t know what materials I needed for what I wanted to build, but I did research online to make what I had work just as well as updated equipment. Finally (what I think is the most important), I have a very excited personality. I love robotics and building more than anything, so I can guarantee I will always be enthusiastic about everything that is taught and all the opportunities to make projects we’re proud of.","I can cook, so I'll bring something to the potluck",,,

This also includes creating a demonstration bike plan for Naperville with Accelerate Climate Solutions. Our goal was to increase bikeability, commerce, and safety in the downtown area. I led the visualization of the bike lane infrastructure with a colleague, and communicated the designs to the rest of the team. During the design process, my colleague and I resolved creative differences through discussion or by consulting our manager, and at the end we were able to agree on designs that incorporated both our ideas. I try to see people’s opinions from their perspective, as I found that to be a good way to evaluate a situation and create a solution that can reach the middle ground in a conflict.

In another project, I worked with two peers, developing a web application for the robotics team at my high school to help streamline their FIRST Robotics Competition process. We designed a tool to display match history, upcoming matches, and team statistics, and embedded the FRC Twitch stream in our application, which they can see in the robotics pit while working on the robot between matches. We used pair programming, collaboratively problem-solved through challenges, and used the Scrum framework to manage our project. We also regularly updated our project manager on our progress and asked questions in order to fulfill client criteria. ","I would be a valuable member of one of the design teams due to my experience in group collaboration through different facets and how I value inclusive collaboration. I’ve taught my business friend to code for the first time, and participated in a few hackathons with themes centered around accessibility and inclusion, like creating a web page for a veteran advocacy program. Helping people is my main motivation for learning technical skills, and I believe being in one of the design teams will help foster this drive because they all connect back to helping humanity. 

While I’m naturally more reserved, I’m not afraid to step up and share my ideas and opinions when necessary. I also have the ability to lead when no one else is willing, even while being mindful of my own weaknesses. In addition, organization is one of my strengths. I stay focused on what matters most to me, which helps me consistently meet deadlines and goals.

In middle school my dad helped me create a robotics team to compete in Vex EDR called Savage Robotics. It was three of us and our coach, my dad. We struggled in the beginning but as time went on we learned and improved winning two tournaments our second year. In the team my role was to be the driving force ensuring we stayed on task and made progress which was difficult for us due to our lack of experience. As time went on and we fell into our roles, making progress became less of an issue. The biggest challenge we faced was becoming too invested in cool, but less optimal idea or design leading to us wasting time and building an inefficient robot. In order to combat this we learned to constantly question our designs. In robotics teamwork is necessary, the one year I was by myself proved that to me. From Vex Robotics I developed a foundation and a passion for robotics that has led me here to VT and Archimedes to further expand on the world of robotics. In Vex I only interacted with a specific portion of robotics due to the setting and hope to expand my horizons through Archimedes and VT. My final big experience in a group project was leading a design team my senior year to create a prototype electric skateboard kit. In this the lessons I learned from Vex aided me in assisting the team to a rocky, but successful end. ","While I could argue that the most valuable thing I would bring to the team is my experience in robotics competitions, or my experience in coding having a solid foundation in Python, C++, and R. Instead I believe the most valuable impact I will have on the team is my passion and my desire to fully commit to succeeding. As a freshman my experience is inevitably flawed and limited. I am smart but not a genius, but what I am is excited. Excited because when I talked to the people at the Archimedes booth at Gobblerfest. I knew I had found what I was looking for. In all of the other design teams I talked to, the impact I would have as a freshman would be limited and ultimately have little to no impact on the team itself. I do not want that. I want to be invested and involved. I want to once again feel the joy of being on an engineering team working together with my teammates to solve an issue, and to do it in a competitive environment. Competition creates drive, it creates necessity, and necessity is the mother of innovation. My experience in robotics may be heavily limited by the heavily regulated nature of Vex Robotics, but I still have solid experience in the engineering method and experience in competing in a competitive environment with harsh deadlines and long hours. My experience will grow, and with it my knowledge. I say this with confidence because I will learn, and I will put in the work. I will do it because I want to, and because it is my passion.","1. While I do have experience in coding I did this because I understand the necessity of coding and how important it is to understand and use in modern day robotics. Coding is not my passion, while I am willing to code and even enjoy it to an extent, my true passion is in designing and iterating constantly improving and testing. 
2. I have a strong desire to lead a team, I have no issue with not being a team leader, but I strongly wish to take on the role and the responsibility. I cannot promise I won't fail, but I can promise to try my best and step down if I can't fulfill the responsibilities of leadership. ",,,

So I started looking into the different fields within healthcare, and that's when I came across Biomedical Engineering. Naturally, as it was time to enroll in courses at my high school I enrolled in Medical and Sustainable Technology.

	In groups we were tasked to create either a board game or a children's book with braille and tactile elements for those who are visually impaired. Later on we were instructed to create a prosthetic hand for those who are physically impaired. The main elements we ensured were enforced was communication, organization, and meeting our end goal. In team settings I truly noticed I truly flourished in organization and, being on the creative side of designing the children's book and prosthetic hand. It is moments like team projects where collaboration and leadership are some of my biggest strengths. Through all of this I ensured all my peers' voices were heard, everyone was delegated equal amounts of work, and in the end we created a children's book and prosthetic hand that our teacher and my team were proud of. 

	
","Leadership, excellence, and citizenship are all necessary qualities I strive to demonstrate every day, especially on a team. 

On the Mondays of every month, I volunteered with the All Stars Club. Consistently volunteering there, I knew everyone. But this one Monday in particular was a night that changed the way I approach leadership roles. As the night began, I saw the familiar faces, except this one face I had never seen before. As this little girl entered the room almost immediately she began crying. In response, the adults locked her and I in a room not letting her out until she stopped crying. Being put into this situation, I noticed I truly flourished in taking initiative. I found myself advocating my concerns to make a difference in this organization. It is situations like this, I proudly take on the challenge of leadership. 

Being an International Baccalaureate student, excellence is one of the most important qualities I have. Sitting in classrooms, listening to the repeated words, “plan”, “essays”, and “deadlines'', I learned how to be organized. Furthermore, I learned how to solve problems as challenges arose. I was constantly thinking outside the box on what could be done to solve something as simple as a math problem, or something on the global scale like cultural awareness.

Leadership, excellence, seeking my highest potential, and making a positive difference in my own life and the lives of others around me are values I had closest to me.

We worked together by assigning different tasks to each other and making sure everyone was participating in some way. Making sure that each person was contributing equally was key and in the end, we were able to complete our labs through collaboration and with very minimal conflict. In addition, I was on my high school's Science Olympiad team and worked with multiple different people in different events, such as Chemistry Lab, Write It Do It, and Forestry. This required lots of patience and work outside of school. Our task was to compete in a regional competition as a team and many of the events I competed in had a test portion. We were only provided one test so we had to either go through questions together or divide and conquer. Usually, the divide and conquer method worked pretty well, but in the forestry event, we had to collaborate throughout the test. My partner and I were able to trade ideas about what we were thinking about and that system worked for us. I like to see how each person likes to work individually in a group so that we can figure out what would work for the team as a whole. ","I would be a valuable member because I have a deep passion for improving the world through engineering. My interests lie in the healthcare field and I believe there should be a focus on improving medical devices for patients with disabilities. I am a problem-solver and enjoy collaborating to reach a common goal. With my experience in Technology Student Association and Science Olympiad in high school, I understand how important deadlines are so I will consistently work throughout the semester so there is no rush right before finals week. I have experience in conflict management within teams and how to get back on track. I will make sure that every team member's idea is heard and discussed before we move on to another. I also believe that a team should spend time together outside of working on the design to bond and grow connections, so I will make an effort toward that from the beginning. This will create a group of team members who work together best and learning each other's personalities and work habits will help us the most.  Overall, I think I would make a valuable contribution because I recognize both the hands-on work needed as well as collaborating with my team members outside of our work is of utmost importance.

Our final project, focused on civil action, challenged us to take a stand in our community about something we were passionate about. We were given a few weeks to work out a plan of action, contact members of our community, and figure out what we wanted to work on.

After discussing for a while, our group found one commonality: that we all at one point went to the gym, and that starting out could be daunting and dangerous. Because of this, we decided on advocating for the implementation of gym safety training in our state's high school health curriculum.

Following this, I recommended we split into roles and contact multiple people on the matter, including multiple senators/congressmen, in case we didn’t get a response. We discussed together who we’d prefer to do, and I chose to reach out to our district's state congressman, senator, and superintendent.

I then worked on a proposal to each member, writing out our cause, steps we could take to get there, and gathered evidence providing proof behind the detriments of exercise if done wrong and the steep learning curve that can follow.

After reaching out and sending follow-up emails, our congresswoman’s assistant reached out for an inquiry.

Following multiple emails, I was able to work out a meeting where we discussed working together to bring it into the framework following the start of Congress’ next session and kept in touch to find other states with similar laws.","As a kid, I used to love to watch medical dramas. Whether it was The Good Doctor or Dr. House, all I wanted to see were the doctors on TV fixing people. As I grew up, I realized I wanted to do that, which led me to becoming an EMT.

I know it’s a bit strange to start off with how I love medicine on an application to an engineering team, but truthfully, I believe that I have learned so many attributes from my training as an EMT that will make an amazing addition.

If there’s one thing you learn straight away during training, it’s that you will not get far without dedicating the time.

To me, this meant spending hours learning the variety of (the way too many) heart conditions, brain injuries, and their treatments. Without learning each intricate detail and how it presents itself in a patient, it’s not just a test you will be failing, but a person too.

When working during ride-time or mock scenarios, the pressure becomes most apparent. This is where you must learn to work together with your team, dictating roles, objectives, and communicating without speaking, with the knowledge that each second wasted is a second that could’ve been spent helping someone.

From my training, I learned how to work under pressure and how to build strong connections with my team.

Additionally, I also believe that through combining to tailor a solution to a patient's symptoms, as well as my second obsession, physics, that I can add a unique approach to problem solving and data gathering.","Nothing important, thank you!

Planning the Japan trip was fun and memorable, but it also educated me in real world skills. Researching and comparing plane tickets, hotels and restaurants taught me how to work within a budget. Figuring out which activities made it into the itinerary forced me to be flexible with my group members. We learned to delegate the responsibilities to make the project easier to accomplish. In the end our group project was successful because the trip went smoothly and was an adventure of a lifetime.
For a school project, we were assigned teams of 4 and our project task was to create disability assistive technology of our choosing. The project had a tight time constraint so our teacher’s expectations were that our final product would be feasible and not technically complex. I was paired up with classmates that I'd never met before, so we introduced ourselves and then we created a group chat for an effective means of communication. When we were finished, we prepared a slideshow showcasing our product and did live demonstrations for the class. Our simple design group project gave me a brief understanding of the engineering design process and how to tackle it in a group setting. It also taught me how to work with people I am unfamiliar with: by being inclusive and understanding. 
","Strong teams can accomplish tremendous feats that would otherwise be impossible for an individual. Through my experiences working with teams in the past, I’ve learned that communication, flexibility and a willingness to learn are the key to harnessing this power. I am excited for the opportunity to ignite this strength on one of the Archimedes design teams. 
My deep interest in science and technology began when the show How the Universe Works stole my attention as a child. Reading books on astronomy and memorizing the names of stars and constellations were a pastime of my early life. On one of the Archimedes design teams, I can use my passion to inspire others and push new boundaries.
Learning how to play my favorite songs on the piano has been one of the most arduous yet rewarding experiences. I spent many nights replaying the same part until I finally got one clean run. The vision of playing the song in front of a large audience gave me the perseverance to see it through. I connected every small section of the song until it blossomed into one linear performance. The feeling of capturing the final product on video or performing it in a recital made all of the struggles worth it. I intend to bring this unrelenting perseverance to Archimedes to tackle its challenges and to be a motivational member of the team.

This was a fairly large team of people from all grades who got together to throw an annual 5k for the school to raise money for charity organizations. Working together with that many people is a very interesting experience, but it definitely teaches some good communication, collaboration, and organizational skills. Getting everybody on the same page and working on what they needed to was a challenge, but we managed to get it done with the use of effective organizational tools and collaboration strategies, such as using google docs to have people sign up for specific jobs.  One of the best parts of group projects like these is seeing everything come together to heights that you wouldn’t be able to reach alone. The Dolphin Dash ended up being a great success, with over $3000 raised for the Beans Way Foundation. 
Of course, I have also participated in many smaller scale group projects in my regular classes. In these situations, I am usually the one to focus the group on what needs to be done and keep everything going the way it should. I always try to include everyone’s opinion on what we should do, and never try to overpower anyone else’s thoughts or ideas with my own. Whoever the other people in the group may be, they always have valuable thoughts, and it is always possible to learn from them. ","The quality that I most value in myself is my eagerness to learn. In nearly every waking moment of my life, I am looking for new things to learn and explore.  One of the ways I do this is by always looking for ways to challenge myself, such as an Archimedes design team. Struggling and wrestling with a concept tin your brain, is the best way to learn something new. That being said, if you are constantly in the face of challenging problems and adversity, there are some qualities that you must embody to be able to endure. The first is perseverance. You will come across failure every once in a while, and that is fine as long as you get back up and keep trying. The next is creativity. The solution to a problem is rarely obvious at first glance. Because of this, being creative is a necessity if you want to search for new solutions to challenging problems. If you can’t explore new ideas and think outside the box a bit, then challenges will become exponentially more difficult or even impossible sometimes. The next trait is diligence. To me, diligence means working hard and remaining focused on the task at hand. It means never taking the easy way out, never neglecting to do important tasks, and never giving up. For someone like me who wants to pursue big dreams in the future, being willing and eager to learn effectively is essential. I think that an Archimedes design team would be the perfect thing for me to challenge myself and learn to my full capabilities.","I have a pretty good understanding of math and physics concepts, and I also have experience in CAD software such as Solidworks. Also, Juvo is my first choice for a design team, as I am planning to major in biomedical engineering, and love to help out people in need.",,,

The roles of the group were pretty simple, I was the planner, who would give an idea of what the app should look like to the user, and how it works, while Andrew would implement the idea into the app, and assemble the code. Unlike many other projects, after a while our roles would be swapped, where I would begin developing the app, and Andrew would give additional ideas and suggest what could be added. In the beginning of the project, we had different ideas, but we quickly learned to collaborate and mesh our ideas together. Occasionally we would work outside of our roles when one of us needed help creating the app, or when we were trying to figure out what else we could add to the app. The experience really helped me get used to collaborating with others, while also becoming flexible enough to contribute in different areas of the project when I could, even when my role is not assigned to that part. Although the app was not created with a specific coding language such as Python, Java, or C, but rather a simple block coding platform like Scratch, it really increased my interest in programming.","I love being very analytical and technical when it comes to physics and engineering of any discipline. I just find learning about physics very fascinating as well as its application to engineering. I also enjoy coding and writing programs for fun in Java. In addition to this, I also enjoy mathematical modeling in Desmos. Recently Desmos have also allowed modeling in 3D, so I have been trying to self teach myself how to create models using equations with three variables. Outside of Desmos, I also have a little experience 3D modeling with Autodesk Inventor.",I have low level autism,,,

In each of these group experiences, I played a very different role. Although I held leadership positions in Botball, MiniTHON, and theatre; I was also put in positions where I had to heed someone else's directions. By being a part of so many different kinds of projects, I learned that being a successful team member is more than just doing your own assigned tasks. It is about supporting and communicating with your teammates in order to maintain an environment where everyone is able to share their ideas freely. Although each was in very different contexts, these projects (and many more) have allowed me to develop my skills in cooperation and leadership while also teaching me to value collaboration.","What would make me a valuable member to a design team is both my experience as well as my diverse/unique perspectives. Due to my previous work positions, I have developed strong communication and empathetic skills that allow me to work well with other people. For example, my internship at the St. Mary's County Health Department allowed me to conduct my own research about racial equity in healthcare and work with current staff members to discuss how our local healthcare system addressed people of many different backgrounds. Along with that, my part time jobs overall allow me to be able to interact and provide people of various backgrounds great service. Additionally, I have some technical experience that would allow me to make positive contributions to the team. Over the past 7 years, I’ve been part of a STEM program in my district which has given me many opportunities to work on complex projects and develop my skills in designing, coding, and problem-solving. Along with technical skills, this long-term involvement has helped me understand how to effectively collaborate with my peers. Through all my experiences, I’ve developed important skills that will allow me to be a valuable member to any team.","I don't think so, but I just wanted to thank you for your time and consideration throughout the application process :)","Unfortunately, on one of the days I had a class that ended right before the interest meeting and I would not have been able to make it.

One of the tasks was ordering supplies for an organization of 300+ people, organizing the supplies when it was delivered, and distributing everything to the right group. I had to work with my coworker and these groups to make sure that everything they needed was ordered and everything was delivered. This involved a lot of communication back and forth to determine quantities of items, specific brands of products, when they were needed by, and figuring out the logistics of how the supplies were to be delivered to them. I also had many projects in school where I was working in a team to complete the task. In my tech ed class one year, I was asked to design and build a tension bridge out of wood sticks in a group. We approached this project by first, each researching and sketching a design that we think would work best. Then we came together and compared designs, modified the one we thought was best with some aspects of other designs, and then split up the tasks of measuring and building the final product that would be tested. I function quite well in a team setting because I enjoy working with others and seeing all the different ideas/points of view that everyone brings to the table. I like building off those ideas as well, and then working together to figure out where to start and how to move forward. ","I would make a valuable member to one of the Archimedes design teams because I am very organized, I don't procrastinate my work and then try to cram it all in at the last second, I'm a self-starter, and I take initiative when something needs to be done. I'm not afraid to speak up when someone isn't doing what they need to be doing or ask a question when I'm confused and need help. I also am really good with communicating with others to get things done. I tend to step into the leadership role when working with a group of people to figure out where to start together. I don't like when interactions and conversations get awkward, so I try to keep the conversation going with everybody and ask questions to get know everyone. I'm someone who wants to feel included and useful, so when I have the opportunity to, I try to make others feel the same way and that they helped out. ",I am extremely interested and passionate about learning more about engineering and the hands-on opportunities that I can do. It makes me super excited when thinking about being part of a team where I can actually contribute to something and that will teach me skills.

In my history class, we were instructed to provide a 20-minute presentation to our class on the rise and fall of Benito Mussolini. As a team, we met twice a week outside of class for about three weeks to research, put together our presentation, and rehearse our presentation. As we collaborated, I naturally took on the role of leader, setting internal deadlines and group meetings that our group agreed would help us be successful. The set deadlines led us to complete our project effectively, and our presentation in class earned flying colors. Another “group project” that I was graciously able to participate in was my high school’s varsity football team. During both my junior and senior years, I was lucky enough to be selected as a captain by my teammates. Perhaps one of my greatest achievements as a player was being able to contribute to something bigger than myself, and also to a win on Friday nights. As captain, I held my teammates accountable for doing their jobs on the field, following their blocks, doing their position assignments, and giving it their all every play. I also remained coachable and took coaching from our coordinators so that I could also be held accountable for my actions. As a team, we rarely ran into complications throughout our season. Although the season did not go as planned, it has been the best group project that I have ever contributed to.","My relentless work ethic. Growing up, I was taught to finish everything 100% and to give it my all no matter what. When that carried into middle school, it eventually led to the creation of my first ever model rocket, which was built in my “Introduction to Engineering” class from start to finish. As I watched my project lift off and fly through the sky, I became instantly hooked and obsessed with engineering. I had never been allowed to build something before and the feeling of finally being able to engineer something so spectacular is a feeling that I could talk on and on about for hours. In high school, my devotion to everything I did followed suit. It followed me onto the field where I played football all four years and earned all-district recognition, and in the classroom where I maintained an above 4.0 grade point average every year pursuant to the IB diploma. It even tagged along over the summer when I attempted to create my second model rocket. From proposing a design for the rocket to researching actual parts for the rocket to even learning how to use OpenRocket from scratch and spending countless hours running simulations. It took me two weeks before the rocket was ready to be built. I never launched the rocket, however, it is safe for me to say that my endless curiosity and willingness to learn and to grow is what I believe will make me a valuable member of one of Archimedes’ design teams. For an opportunity like this, I just can’t pass it up.",,,,

In my troop, we had the Patrol Leader Council (PLC), a group of around ten scouts who worked together to plan the troop meetings and activities.

As a member of the PLC, I learned how to work together with other scouts to plan activities. I learned to work out any disagreements we had while planning (which happened a lot) and get work done on time. We also stressed the importance of everyone being able to share their opinions and ideas. I found this to be helpful as we ended up coming up with better ideas when we were able to build off each other.

I also planned multiple activities and events for the troop, usually with a couple of other scouts. Some of these include a Halloween party, an orienteering course, and multiple troop requirement lessons. I learned how to delegate work and ensure we worked together to implement our ideas in a timely manner.

I was eventually elected to be the Senior Patrol Leader (SPL), a position in charge of running the entire troop and the PLC. As SPL I made sure the PLC members had the guidance and resources to be able to effectively plan their activities. My role was more of being a mentor rather than just a boss and I taught them the process for planning the events and working as a team within the PLC.","My greatest contribution to the design team will be my ability to problem-solve and come up with ideas for solving a given problem. For example, I faced a problem with learning my music scales for my all-district band auditions in High School. I then created my own app called Scale Master to help me learn my scales. The app guides you step by step on how to play a particular scale and allows you to practice it over and over. Scale Master worked great, and I was able to learn my scales in time for my audition.


I do have prior programming experience in the form of the IOS apps I have created, such as my Scale Master app. My programming knowledge would help me work on the project within the design team.


My experience working on my own projects and completing each step of the design process, from coming up with the idea to finally having a working product, will allow me to be successful in working on the Archimedes design team projects.

As the Lead Researcher and Developer, I helped design a mini solar panel system that increased efficiency by 20% and developed an automated cleaning device that extended its lifespan by 15%. This project wasn’t just about solar energy—it was about creating sustainable solutions to improve energy efficiency and make a real-world impact.

At Cisco Solutions, I also worked on an AI Chatbot and Ransomware Solution, collaborating with a team to enhance cybersecurity using machine learning. This experience demonstrated my passion for applying technology to solve real-world problems, especially in areas like healthcare.

Through these experiences, I’ve learned to thrive in team settings, where clear communication, flexibility, and creative problem-solving are essential. I’m excited about opportunities with organizations like Archimedes, where I can use my skills to design solutions for people with disabilities, or even contribute to NASA’s mission of space exploration, making a positive difference through engineering.

In addition, I’ve taken on leadership roles outside of engineering. I served on my class council for three years, where I was Vice President and managed all of our subcommittees, ensuring we met every deadline and event goal. These experiences, though challenging, taught me how to work effectively with people through difficult times.","In high school robotics, I participated in various competitions and projects where I applied my engineering knowledge to solve real-world problems. One of my capstone projects was designing a device to prevent or at the very least decrease smash-and-grab car thefts. This device was built to detect potential threats to a vehicle's windows, such as sudden impacts or temperature changes that could signal a break-in or emergency. We used sensors to monitor these conditions, and the system would automatically deploy a Kevlar (military-grade fabric) cover over the windows when needed. This project sharpened my skills in sensor integration, circuit design, and developing responsive systems—skills that are especially valuable in robotics, where autonomous systems and quick decision-making are critical, such as in teams like Terra.

As a member of any design team, I bring the technical skills I’ve gained, such as understanding electrical systems, automation, and implementing them with computer software using robotic components. I combine these with creative problem-solving to contribute to innovative projects.","One thing I’d like to emphasize is that I’m a hard worker and always willing to put in extra hours to support the team. I believe in creating an environment where everyone feels heard and involved, so we can effectively design our projects and plan our schedules. My goal is not just to help us win, but to ensure that we all learn and grow in the process, because as engineering students, we’re here to find ways to improve the world around us, one step at a time.

As a freshman, I have an elementary level of experience with machinery. While it may take me a few tries to master certain tools, I’m fully committed to learning and improving. I’m especially interested in Archimedes at O-Show and would love to be part of a team of like-minded people who share my passion for engineering and problem-solving.

The following year, our team entered the First Tech Challenge (FTC), where I programmed the robot's autonomous mode, helping us place fourth in our region despite being newcomers without a mentor. I also joined a First Robotics Competition (FRC) team, where I learned about competition dynamics and contributed to building a robot for waste management.
By my senior year, we had used TensorFlow for machine learning, enabling our robot to make decisions based on camera input. We incorporated new components like a linear slide and overcame competition challenges, effectively applying my coding skills.
As club president, I addressed post-pandemic communication issues by organizing team-building activities, introducing psychological counseling, and using a suggestion box for anonymous feedback. These efforts improved communication and fostered a collaborative environment.
I also researched competitions, analyzed past events, and consulted other teams to prepare us better. We successfully completed the game season by organizing tasks and leading our efforts, enhancing our skills and team cohesion.

My task was to configure all the VLANs and have them running. During this time, I tried to communicate to my team my progress and checked on theirs as well. If I noticed if someone's configuration wasn’t working, I would try to assist to help move us forward. During our down times and sometimes while we worked, I would joke with them to get morals high. When I finished up my assigned tasks, I would try and go around to see if anyone is in need of assistance. This is a way of keeping me occupied and keeping the team on task. This is very similar to the time I worked in a group competition last October. There were some areas in the competition I was not knowledgeable on but I would try my best to help my teammates in their task and provide moral support if I couldn’t assist.

In our study, I naturally shifted between these roles. My role involved developing algorithms to optimize quantum computations. I was deeply invested in refining these algorithms to compare their performance against classical algorithms for predicting material properties. I led discussions on the program's functions and how to present our work to a broader audience. Other times, I took a step back and supported my teammates who were focused on other critical components like integrating our program with existing technology.

This ability to balance leading and following, depending on the situation, was key to our team’s success. The dual approach of leadership and followership is particularly important in Juvo with solutions being grounded in the actual needs and feedback of the users.","What sets me apart is my belief that appearance matters just as much as functionality, especially when designing products for people with disabilities. As engineers, we often joke that “if it works, it works. No further question needed,” but when it comes to creating devices for someone with unique challenges, the design needs to go above simply working – it must empower. A product can solve a problem functionally, but if it feels awkward, looks unappealing, or is difficult to interact with, it can create an additional barrier instead of removing one. 

As a member of Juvo, I would apply this mindset by ensuring these tools fit seamlessly into the user’s everyday life. I would consider not just how efficiently it performs tasks, but also how it looks and feels – does it allow the user to feel capable and comfortable, or does it stand out in a way that makes them feel different? I view the Juvo design team as an opportunity to create something that not only solves problems but also reshapes how people interact with the world around them.

Additionally, I understand that as designers, it’s important to test these products with the people they are meant for because my perspective, no matter how empathetic, can never fully capture the lived experience of someone with a disability. Feedback and input from potential users are crucial to making sure our design truly meets their needs in ways we may not have initially considered. ","My passion for becoming a part of the Juvo team is connected to my long-term career goals. I am an A. James Clark Scholar majoring in General Engineering with an intended focus on Mechanical Engineering, specifically aiming to specialize in robotics. My career aspirations are centered around developing robotics solutions that improve accessibility across communities. Juvo’s mission to design adaptive technologies strongly aligns with my own goals and interests. What excites me the most about Juvo is the opportunity to develop visions into solutions that make a real difference in people’s lives. Juvo’s impressive projects, such as the clicker band mouse replacement are small, but impactful ways to make life for some just a little bit easier. I am highly interested in Juvo and am grateful for the chance to apply. 

In high school, I was actively involved in several key roles and activities: I served as president of FBLA, where I earned first place in Social Media Strategies at both the regional and state levels and learned the impact of product marketability; as co-president of my school's Girls Who Code Chapter, I taught elementary school students to code (Python and Java) and mentored younger students; I participated in the Virginia Tech Pathways for Future Engineers program, where my team placed third in the Marshmallow Experiment Rube Goldberg machine and first in an engineering design competition for Virginia Tech STEP; I also developed strong technical skills in MATLAB, applying them effectively in various projects, such as my project in Quantum-Augmented Machination for the Quantum World Congress.

In one of my favorite teams I've work with, we built a robot that could read and play music (think a 2x2ft piano that played music from a roll of paper). What allowed our team to be so successful is that we often held review sessions so that everyone was on the same page of what's been done and what still needs worked on. I also felt comfortable with re-evaluating design choices we made and bringing up concerns that would have caused problems later on in the project timeline. I work best in team settings when I have the responsibility of building a part of a project and communicating with other team members to integrate it smoothly into the overall project.","In a recent project, I was part of a team of 3 that designed, built, and coded a VR controlled robotic arm. This was a very in-depth task that required me to research from many engineering disciplines. I learned how to manage a budget, work with Stepper Motors and RF, CAD Gears and structural supports, and design a communication network between Unity VR and Arduino. I'm saying this not because I believe I'm an expert in any one field but to show that I'm outcome driven. When a project requires a skill that's not being worked on, I often step up to learn and develop what's needed with full effort and concentration. While I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering, I'm really motivated by Engineering as a whole. The design process, overcoming challenges, and solving puzzles are what gives me fulfillment.

Ultimately, I want to learn more skills and expand my depth of knowledge. I feel that Archimedes will give me a variety of opportunities to learn and apply my knowledge while creating a physical and meaningful impact. ","If applicable, I've gotten clearance for Ware Lab and inVenTs studio",,,

NASA Hunch is a collective of students that seek to create new inventions meant to better the lives of the astronauts on the International Space Station, whether that be through medical equipment, culinary items, or even hardware. During my time with this program, I was able to work well with my fellow students, many of whom I had never met before. As secretary, I was responsible for documenting every meeting with what we did, how we did it, and goals for the future meetings, but I was also responsible for writing in the engineering notebook and design much of what we had talked about during meetings. Not only did being a part of this club grow my skills to work with a team, it also allowed me to make friends, many of whom I still keep up with today. 
	During my junior year of high school, however, was when I made my true contributions to my high school. In conjunction with the Science National Honor Society, a group which I held membership with at the time, I created a tutoring hub for students who were struggling with science classes. Along with the president and vice president of the SNHS, we brought science to the forefront of every student’s attention and raised the pass rates at our school significantly. The following year, as a senior and president of the SNHS, those numbers grew even more, growing into a fully fledged center dedicated to helping students in need.
","I’m not going to try to convince you that I’m the smartest person who is applying, or the most idealistic and creative candidate, but I do know that I will be the most dedicated to continuing on my personal goal of making the world a better place. In high school, my goal was to create unity amongst the student body, something that I helped to closer achieve with my work with the National Honor Society, Science National Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta, and several other organizations. With Archimedes, especially the Astra and Micro-g NExT projects, I believe that I can truly make a difference and better the experiences and make the job of space exploration easier, but from down here on Earth. I’m not going to have the most technical skill when it comes to engineering, but I am willing to learn. I want to push myself to gain these abilities that can be used to help others. I believe that working with the team in the Archimedes organization I can truly make a difference. I want to find my people and I think those people will be found in this group of dedicated students who all want to improve the lives of others just as much as I do. ",,,,

I have held Team Captain, Co-team Lead and individual contributor roles. As a project leader, I really enjoyed teaching new members about robotics and working together to brainstorm ideas to develop a competitive robot, and then putting those ideas into action. However, I am equally happy stepping into any role on a team, even if it’s not a leadership position. I like working with people who are passionate about a common goal.

Another project I recently worked on was designing and prototyping a product to present to Bloomsburg Engineers. I found myself being the link between the design and assembly groups of our project. This project made me realize I work well under pressure- in the pivotal hours leading up to a presentation or competition, I am able to stay calm and help direct other team members.

I really thrive in team settings. I am generally a happy and willing contributor and try to inspire my teammates even when we have tough challenges to solve. The experience of solving challenges together is what I enjoy most about group work, and I love bonding with a team while working together on something we are passionate about.
","I have a lot of experience with designing and building robots from scratch. Over my time on a robotics team, I have worked on 4 robots that had unique sets of challenges. I love the brainstorming process, and am good at coming up with unconventional yet effective ways to complete challenges. I also enjoy working with other people that share my passion for technology and problem solving. Whether on Terra, Astra, or another team, I think I have many skills I can share to help make a difference.

Additionally, I have significant experience with assembly and using various power tools including bandsaws, scroll saws, belt sanders, drill presses, and more. I am good at improvising - when we didn’t have quite the right parts on my Robotics team, I would find ways to work around it, resulting in some pretty cool design choices. I also have a good amount of experience with java programming.

I am also able to teach technological skills to others- this past summer I was an instructor at a local makerspace where I taught 6 camps on Robotics and Drones for students ages 5-15. However, I am just as happy to learn from others as I am to teach. 

The most important thing I want you to know about me is that I am a versatile team player - I can build, lead, joke around, encourage, coach and help lift up my teammates. I strive to be a fun, but focused worker and would welcome the opportunity to be part of and contribute to an Archimedes design team as I begin my career at Virginia Tech.

We were supposed to use software to analyze telescopic images of Asteroids. I was a part of a two-member team. We held regular Zoom meetings to analyze images of the night sky together. In addition, we talked on the phone regularly to set up a meeting time we were both comfortable with. Whenever he was busy I filled in for him and visa versa. We had set clear guidelines on how to operate and we knew that if one of us didn't do the work as assigned, we wouldn't receive credit for the asteroid discovery. I often reminded him of the deadlines and motivated him to continue working towards the goal. We were considerate of each other's time and worked efficiently. Overall it was a smooth experience. I would say I work extremely well in a team setting as I can both lift up my teammates and understand if they are going through something tough and fill in for them. ","I am very dedicated and I am willing to put in whatever effort is needed to create the product which will win us the competition. In addition, I have experience with Python and Java and have created several projects and games in high school. I was also a part of a design team in 8th grade and we designed an Ultrasonic Dustbin. Mainly my role was pitching the product to the judges. They ended up liking my pitch and we won second place overall among 50 teams! I am also disciplined and I like to manage my time effectively using various tools which will help me and our team prevent any kind of last-minute stress.  I like to be meticulous about things and I am not satisfied until something is perfect.

We built and trained a quick machine learning model that predicted the likelihood of developing certain heart conditions with a quick non-invasive test. Additionally, I’ve worked on an engineering design team as part of a high school senior year-long capstone project. In that year, my team and I designed and built an inverse kinematic, balancing quadruped robot. Finally, I’ve also worked on a group project to design and build a self-driving car using reinforcement learning algorithms to teach it how to maneuver an obstacle course. Throughout all of these group projects and their success and failures, I’ve learned how to function properly in a team setting. In team settings, I like to function by dividing up the work into manageable parts between all members of a group depending on what each member is knowledgeable and passionate about. I like to hold group meetings frequently to talk over individual progress where members can detail their work and thought process and receive valuable feedback from other members who can give different perspectives to tackle the problem. This collaboration ensures that everyone knows what they’re working on and has a reliable source for feedback in order to ensure that they’re going about their design in the most efficient way possible. ","I feel like I would make a valuable member to one of the design teams because of my 5 years of coding experience. I’ve been coding since I’ve been in middle school and have learned a variety of coding languages including Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and HTML. I also have experience with 3D modeling having worked with SolidWorks and Fusion 360 to design and build robots in the past. I have experience with electrical circuit design too with experience in LTSpice and KiCAD. Finally, I also have hands-on experience with various forms of hardware such as microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi and various sensors that I’ve used in past robotics.  I’ve been a member of robotics and coding clubs for all of my time in high school, and I believe this experience would be incredibly valuable when designing and building projects for a freshmen design team. 

In addition to my technical experience, I believe I would be a valuable addition to a design team because of teamwork skills. From my many past group projects, I’ve learned the importance of having direct, accurate, and quick forms of communication so that every member of a group knows the current status of all parts of a project whether that be the software design, the CAD, or the proposal writing. I also am good at problem solving and providing quick solutions to issues that arise. Because of these technical and nontechnical skills, I believe that I would be a valuable addition to one of the Archimedes design teams.",,,,

We competed in a yearly regional robotics innovation challenge. The competition differed every year but lasted two days and usually involved an obstacle course. Preparation before the competition involved assembling the team, recruiting members and enrolling in basic python coding classes. It was important for us to get to know each other and become comfortable working with each other in a stressful setting.  Once it came to the competition, we delegated tasks based on strengths. I led the mechanical side of building the robot and 3D printing the parts, while my friend, a computer science enthusiast, handled the coding. The rest of our team had specific roles that supported each side. I was responsible for frequent check-ins with team members and reassessing our group objectives.  We also made it a point to regularly seek input from each other to gain diverse perspectives on problem-solving. Our effective collaboration ultimately led to our success and first place finish. ","In my senior year of high school, I spontaneously joined theater and became part of the costumes, hair and makeup crew. Each night was another test to my creativity and resourcefulness as I set out, armed with safety pins and bobby pins and ready to handle last-minute costume and hair adjustments. Over the course of working on three plays, I saw firsthand how even small roles can make a significant impact on the overall production. Much like robotics, it taught me a lot about problem solving in stressful situations and good teamwork even under pressure. I’m confident my creative skills developed through theater, as well as my hard work, and dedication would make me a valuable asset to one of your design teams. ","I would love the opportunity to join any of your design teams, but I am particularly interested in Juvo. During high school, I was actively involved in volunteering within my local community, where I saw firsthand the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities.

However, I have an ultimate passion for my interest and become an active member of the team. 
One group project representing me was the Scrambler car competition held in class. At first, our team was confused about how to build a car with a unique braking system. Taking the lead, I studied videos of the actual competition and analyzed successful designs used by others. This research allowed me to figure out the braking system before anyone else in the class. And it was my turn to demonstrate it to my teammates. 
However, the team's motivation was still low, and I didn't want this project to be just another easy assignment with minimal effort. I motivated and encouraged our team. Their attitude didn't change just in one day, but we ended up doing what we were supposed to do. Then, we faced a major step back. The day before the deadline, our prototype failed to meet expectations.
While the rest of the team was disappointed, I chose to stay late in the lab and explore various solutions. After persistent experimentation, I found a possible solution and presented it to the team the next day. Despite having only 30 minutes left, I assigned tasks to them with my ideas. My encouragement and determination helped re-lit our passion, achieving 2nd place in the competition. This experience presented my ability to lead, problem-solve under pressure, and maintain a positive and proactive attitude.","My strength is positivity, responsibility, and passion. 
My positivity helps me stay calm and focused even in a hard time. According to my past experiences in team projects, I learned that maintaining positivity is crucial for stepback and problem-solving skills. I'm also capable of motivating and encouraging our team, making an environment where we all can enjoy and take what we need. 
I take responsibility for the task assigned to me put to the best of my ability and never give up. I have never been late or have negatively impacted others. I might not be the one always standing up and leading the team, but I could be a person who is reliable at their task and the best partner along the journey 
Last but not least, I'm very passionate about learning something new or something I'm interested in, making me seek to improve my skills and knowledge. Engineering is indeed one of my passions and will behave the best of myself for the best quality for the team. I'm eager to learn, face challenges, and experience. 
With this strength, I believe that I'll be a valuable resource in a team. ","Right now, I'm just a novice freshman. There are several reasons why I want to join this club. It would be amazing to win an award or achieve something great. However, my main goal in joining this club is to gain hands-on experience with things that I can't learn in the classroom; hands-on experience is a thousand times more valuable than the theories we learn in the classroom. I wanted an environment where we could all learn new skills and do our best. I particularly like this team because everyone is a freshman. Unlike other clubs where older students lead and we have to follow their instructions, in this team, we can all discuss what we want to do and share our opinions.

With my team of 17 officers including myself and another co-president, we formed bonds that were unexpected for all of us. I barely knew my fellow officers prior to being elected as co-president but through team-bonding and mutual understanding, we were able to overcome any obstacle.

Becoming used to working as a team that specific roles and abilities was difficult, after all, it was my first time telling people what to do and then making sure it got done but it almost came naturally. Difficult teammates is a given in any group setting but finding a way around that so differences could be overcome came in the simplest ways. Treating others with respect and dignity provides results and in ensuring quality events for our members and community, it was necessary. A team is only as strong as its ability to work together and in doing so, it is able to do what no sole person could ever accomplish on their own.","A reoccurring issue I have is my ability to remember important events, rather, the ones that seem unimportant plague my mind. With that said, however, one memory blesses my mind every second of the day. Staring up at the stars from the windows of my mom's minivan. Since before I can remember, the stars have been my happy place, but, as I grew older, life became more confusing. As I was applying to colleges and assessing my past and filling out all those stupid boxes and what not on my CommonApp, I questioned what it was I really wanted to do. My dad said engineer, my mom said doctor, my sisters said Orthodox Monk, but none of these spoke to me. Then, one day, everything clicked. I want to be an astronaut. Adventure and exploration is any young lad or lass's dream but for me, it wasn't just a dream, its something I will make a reality. Finding comfortability in the environments I find myself in is becoming more difficult as I grow but when things get stressful or I start to doubt myself, a night laying on the grass staring at the stars fills me with more energy than a nuclear plant. I am not here to put something on my resume, I'm applying to Astra because I will make my dream a reality. Life isn't only about chasing your passion, its also about inspiring others to chase theirs's. As a part of Astra I want to not only improve myself but those around me, because, as Emma Stone so strongly said in La La Land, ""People love what other people are passionate about.""",I have never wanted something more than to be apart of this team.

I led a community project, which assisted a middle school student  with disabilities to play the trumpet in the band. We designed and produced a tool to assist the student to press down the trumpet valves with just a press of a button. During this project I arranged team members, resources, assigned tasks and managed the timeline so that the project was completed on time and the tool was delivered to use. Being on this team, participating in different projects, I played many different roles. As a team member, I learned efficiently to communicate with project leaders to clarify tasks and specifications, and cooperate with other team members to complete tasks efficiently.

Most of the time, team projects are in randomly assigned groups where people are reluctant to talk or give input. In these scenarios I’d usually try to speak out more and try to encourage more open communication and sharing of ideas. However, with my close group of friends, I encountered the exact opposite problem. No one was scared to share their ideas, which led to lots of clashing between group mates. As a group comfortable with each other, many were not afraid to insult each other or other’s ideas. What saved the group, however, was splitting up my groupmates’ work as a form of compromise. Each person could do their own work their own way, with me being a form of contact between the group members rather than having communication that was a bit too open. This taught me that group dynamics greatly affect how you should plan as a team and that a good leader can adapt to their scenario. ","I'd be a valuable member to the Archimedes design teams because of my technical skills, work ethic, and genuine passion for engineering. With a lot of transfer credits, I’ve already completed most of my introductory courses and started to take more specialized classes. This will bring a unique perspective to a team of freshmen, as I’d have more of theoretical background to our work. However, I also have a solid foundation in engineering principles and hands on experience. Last year I conducted research on improving Mars rover soil mechanics by using alternative wheel designs, which was later presented at both RSEF and the GMU research symposium. It was during this research that I gained a background in CAD, manufacturing skills, and electronics, as I had to create a model rover and 3D printed wheels for testing. Research didn't only teach me technical aspects of design, but also allowed me to practice learning from my mistakes and revising my work to overcome problems, which will help the team tackle complex problems and find innovative solutions. I enjoy approaching difficult projects that require dedication and design problems to solve, so I’m not afraid to put in the extra effort to meet deadlines and ensure success. I always relished in watching Mark Rober and other's videos since I was a kid, so I'm enthusiastic to finally get the opportunity for more hands-on engineering experience.

In a more technical scenario, when I was Co-President of my school’s rocketry team, I ensured that our rocket mirrored our simulation exactly, while accounting for potential errors. Even when I don’t play a leadership role, like during my time interning for Centrifuge LLC, an IT consulting company, I strived to ensure that my team produced the best possible project. After developing an AI model to track real-time objects, I worked diligently to run numerous tests and train it to recognize any new object with the highest precision. These experiences have helped me better my ability to maintain high standards in team settings. In terms of managing a team, I can ensure that our group is on track and set goals for us to complete on time. From my attention to detail and overall perfectionist attitude, I will make sure that each project is executed flawlessly and meets competitive standards. Ultimately, out of all that I can provide to a group, being the editor is my most effective contribution, and I can’t wait to showcase my skills on Archimedes.","Aside from what I can contribute in a team setting, my personal assets truly round out my overall application. Having a specialized interest in the Infinitum team, I believe I have what it takes to compete with other developers. Firstly, my technical skills. As a freshman, there is a vast amount of knowledge that I have yet to delve into, but I have already taken the first few steps. In my previous position at STEMVocate, I was tasked with building the official organization website. Implementing HTML and CSS, my team and I not only created but effectively managed the site. These frontend development skills are vital to any application I will work on at Infinitum. While interning with Centrifuge LLC, I explored open-source AI models, specifically YOLOv5, using Python. I integrated AI into IP cameras, enabling real-time tracking of any object that appeared in their view. With YOLOv5 and other AI integrations, there are endless problems waiting to be solved. Beyond my technical skills, I believe my mindset is a strong asset. Building an app requires patience and determination—qualities I have demonstrated in my previous projects. I am eager to tackle new challenges and am excited to contribute to Archimedes. Given my hands-on experience and proactive mindset, I am confident that I am the ideal candidate for the Infinitum team.",,,,

In the VASTS program, I served as a System Deputy, where I was responsible for overseeing team members' work, managing work assignments, and ensuring consistency across the team.
During my internship at Permiso Security, I worked in a small team on various software development projects. As a project lead, I coordinated with other interns, delegated tasks, and reviewed their work before presenting it to company employees. For projects where I was not the lead, I focused on coding or testing as assigned by the project lead.
At the Chick-fil-A Leadership Academy, I collaborated with five other students on various charity events, some of which were sponsored by Chick-fil-A. This role involved active participation in both the planning and execution stages of these events.","I believe my background in both technical skills and teamwork skills makes me a strong candidate for your design team. My technical skills include proficiency with CAD software and technical writing, and I have hands-on experience with manufacturing from an introductory electrical engineering course, where I designed and soldered basic circuits. Additionally, my experience working in high-pressure environments, such as during the VASTS program and my internship, has honed my ability to collaborate effectively and produce quality work under tight deadlines. I also have a passion for these collaborative engineering projects, which I believe is shown in my previous experience. ",,,,

On ASP we travel to the Appalachia region to repair the homes of low income families. This is not exactly a group project, but I think it exemplifies my cooperation in a team setting the best. The first years I volunteered, I took more of a backseat role on the team. I had some experience in construction but wasn't confident enough to make decisions on the worksite. I listened to my group leaders and worked hand in hand with the other kids in my group to get the project done. My final year though, I took more of a leadership role on the worksite. I was the only veteran on my team and only one of the adults on the site had construction experience. We had two projects on the site that needed to get done so I took up leading the group to install underpinning. I taught my team members how to use tools they had no experience with and let them try things. I learned the importance of letting people fail as long as it is safe. We ended up finishing the project on time, and by the end of the week I felt much closer to my team and proud of the work we accomplished.
With the few characters I have left I'll just summarize some other stuff I did in highschool. I was a member of engineering club where we built things for different school organizations. I worked as a restaurant host where cooperation is vital to the job. Finally, I was on the student council where we planned school events.","There are a few reasons I'd like to highlight that make me a valuable member of a design team. First and foremost, I perform well in a group setting. Now I don't think I need to expand on that much in this question based on the last one, but just know that I will be an active and helpful member of any Archimedes team. Next, I do have a good amount of experience with certain valuable skills. I am pretty proficient in Java and Python and know a bit of C++ from messing around with an Arduino. I also have a lot of experience in CAD and 3D printing. I know my way around most of the basic tools found in a workspace, but not many of the more advanced machines. All of this experience gives me a great jumping off point to dive in through Archimedes and learn more skills and techniques. Finally I would say my passion for solving a problem makes me valuable. One of the reasons I decided to go into a major as math and CS heavy as CMDA was because I love to work through problems. I can spend hours on a difficult coding task or a hard math problem without getting distracted. I love the feeling of when you finally finish and you can look at the end result and all the work you did to get there and feel proud.",,,,

In every group setting, I work to be consistent and reliable, and I always give merit to other people’s ideas. The group project I participated in that I am most proud of is my own Eagle Scout project. I got to work with councilors, administrators, and dozens of scouts over four months to achieve my goal. I aimed to revitalize a monument at Piney Woods, a historically black boarding school. I planned the project with the school principal, dean, and agricultural specialist. We set up a budget to purchase materials with a grant acquired from a nearby business. On the day of the project, I directed the cleaning of the stone monument, as well as the mulching, and replanting of old flower beds surrounding it. It was a wonderful experience, and I learned a great deal about leadership, and how to compromise with teammates so that everyone feels included. 
","I would make a valuable member of one of the design teams because I understand what it takes to be a part of a long-term team project. Time on my school’s Speech and Debate team gave me much of that experience. I compare being on the debate team to being on a design team because I imagine the learning process I will go through to be an effective team member will be similar to what I went through in debate. When I first joined in 7th grade, I knew nothing, but I was passionate and willing to learn. Coaches and some kind seniors took the time to show me the ropes. As I became familiar enough not to need help, my usefulness as a team member began to show. Most group work involved pairing into small teams and rehearsing our pieces or research to win tournaments. I was known on the team for coming up with good blocking ideas, and people liked working with me because I never put anyone down, and I accepted criticism gratefully. To be successful in Speech and Debate, you have to spend time with your team iterating, reiterating, researching for stronger material for your scripts, and constantly rehearsing all school year. Because I stayed on the team so long, I became captain during my senior year, helping novice members like old seniors did. I understand that to be a good teammate, you must be willing to sacrifice time and have patience. As a member of one of the design teams, I would provide that same time, patience, and passion for learning as I did for my debate team.",Attended interest meeting 8/31/24,,,

One of my most impressive projects in high school was building a 12ft trebuchet. This project took 8 weeks but we were able to combine data analytics, hands on experience, and communication to let this work. I was able to be a team leader while also stepping back when I faced my weaknesses. I was not the best at hands on, I learned from my teammates on how to help them.

Another way I have worked in a team, was in a more professional setting: a data science internship. I worked with a project manager, professional writer, and different clientele. I was the intern and needed to quickly learn how to collaborate on a team, especially virtually. I helped present my findings in my meetings and how to stay on track for deadlines. But as we all know, sometimes deadlines have to be pushed back, and I learned how to comeback from that.","While we are only freshman, this organization helps give us an opportunity where many other organizations would make us ""bring coffee"". I value this chance to be a part of a design team, because I want to be able to make a difference. Whenever I am passionate about a project, I put my heart and soul into it. I am prepared to do that with any design team I may be a part of. I like to take charge in projects, but these design teams can teach many other useful skills. I am a good communicator and I can explain hard concepts to a person with no expertise in my field. I believe that I am hardworking, a problem solver, and reliable. 

When there is a project, I believe that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. I am prepared to use my strengths to an advantage but to also strengthen my weaknesses. While I am an extremely reliable person to have on team, I hope to become more organized. I like to think outside of the box to create new ideas on how to help someone else. The main reason why I think I would be a valuable team member on one of your design teams is because I want to help people, make a difference, and create something new.

These projects included feeding the homeless, building wheelchair ramps, and providing a wide range of community outreach services.  During my first year as a young volunteer, I tended to follow more experienced members and provided a helping hand to the team, but as time went on and I gained more overall knowledge and experience, I began to utilize my skills to allow for critical thinking and team building.  After gaining this trust with my team, I was then referred to during times of problem solving and was the first point of contact from mission and church faculty.  Having this connection with all members of the team was crucial to our success, as every year we faced a new challenge in our community, we were able to combine our knowledge and execute accordingly due to our high level of team functionality.  I believe these abilities would extend into the Archimedes team and would allow us to be successful with any complication we may encounter.","I believe the most important part of any functional team is the ability to combine every individual's unique strengths into one cohesive force by using effective communication.  Previously as the Drum Captain for my high school’s marching band, I was able to combine the various strengths the members of the drumline had, despite various adversities and challenges.  One of these challenges was being able to communicate with those who do not respond to traditional methods of instruction.  After acknowledging this setback, I approached new ways of communicating to my peers.  Some of these methods involved teaching by example and having open conversations about current goals and objectives.  As a part of the Archimedes team, I would be able to apply these leadership skills in order to inspire innovative problem solving techniques and joint collaboration.  Effective communication is essential to any successful team, and I know that is where I can give value to our future Archimedes team.",,,,

Although not a traditional group project, working on the technical crew in theatre had the same aspects as any group project, just on a larger scale. 

My role as the head of the lighting department helped me develop necessary collaborative skills such as delegation, organization, and communication with the rest of the lighting team, as well as the heads of other technical departments. Each semester, a new show posed a new challenge and a short timeline, and from that, I learned the importance of delegating tasks. I came to understand what specific skills each member of the lighting team possessed and what tasks they could easily take on for us to complete everything efficiently before opening night. In addition to leading my department, I was also tasked with taking point when communicating with other departments. Through this, I learned to compromise, adapt to others' ideas and decisions, and work within constraints set for me by my director and the tools and time I had available to work with. 

I am incredibly grateful for my experience working on a technical theatre team because it helped me develop vital teamwork skills that are applicable to any group work setting. In group projects in my classes afterward, I was comfortable working with a new group of people and using these teamwork skills to plan and execute a large-scale project.","I believe I would be a valuable member on one of Archimedes' design teams because I thrive in a group work setting and I understand the challenges and responsibilities that come with it. I am punctual and consistent, and I always do my part and help wherever necessary because I know that everyone in a team relies on each other. I am open-minded to new ideas, and I speak up when I have ideas of my own. I am eager to learn more about project planning, technical building skills, and more. 

But one of the most important things I’ve kept in mind is something that a teacher told my class once: “It’s not about you”. I found it simple and strangely blunt at first but now I can understand its deeper meaning. Working on a group project and being a part of a team means doing the best of your ability to support your team. It means compromising because it is in the interest of your team, not in the interest of any individual person. It means keeping the team at the forefront of your goals, not yourself. I think it is important to remember that because teams inevitably encounter conflicts, so I believe that having the mindset of conflict resolution by way of acting in the interest of the team is incredibly powerful and one reason that I would make a valuable addition to an Archimedes design team.",The design teams I am most interested in are Astra and Terra.,,,

It was a great experience and a great introduction into team projects. As a team, we were given the task to create an instrument or a sound producing device. After weeks of planning we came up with an idea to recreate a piano that had been disassembled and install a metronome. The only major thing we were given were the piano strings that were tightened. As a team, we redesigned a striking mechanism using CAD. As well as learning many new techniques, my favorite being a woodworking technique where you steam wood long enough to where the fibers become elastic and you can mold it into any shape you would like. Throughout the project we worked very well as a team, similar to Archimedes and many workplaces, we were not given the choice of choosing out partners. This gave us insight to the future where we will not necessarily be given the choice of who we would like to work with. Although given the circumstances, we worked very well together and completed the project early. I also worked in a team in my senior outreach volunteer project. For our project we decided to build park benches for the school to replace the old rusted and molded ones that were in the courtyard. Given the time constraint we had to pick schematics from online rather than designing our own bench but non the less both of them came out very well. To make the process go smoother, as a team we split up the roles to make the production go a lot smoother. ","	Over my three years of work experience and throughout my academic journey, I have come to realize that my greatest strength is my eagerness to learn. This quality, from what I understood at the Archimedes interest meeting, is crucial for success on the team. As we navigate projects with the guidance of advisors, we will need to be self-driven, often conducting independent research to solve problems and acquire new knowledge. This process excites me, as I believe learning should be a continuous pursuit, especially in a collaborative and innovative environment. My enthusiasm for learning has been shaped by both my professional experiences and my academic endeavors. In my job roles, I’ve not only learned new skills but have also trained and guided others. However, it is in my academic work where this passion truly comes to life. Throughout high school, I consistently challenged myself with advanced coursework, such as AP Calculus BC in my junior year, Dual Enrollment Multivariable Calculus, and AP Physics C: Mechanics. These rigorous courses required extensive dedication, study, and preparation beyond the classroom. Engaging with these subjects at such a high level has not only strengthened my problem-solving skills but also prepared me for the challenges of a freshman design team. I believe this background equips me with a unique perspective and the readiness to dive deep into complex topics, collaborate effectively, and contribute meaningfully to the team.",,,,

For AP seminar, we had to conduct research and an 8 minute presentation without flashcards. We chose to problem solve the destruction caused by tourists on the Great Wall of China. 
I acted as a team partner where this team did not have a leader. Therefore, without a leader, task delegation was critical and that's where I helped out the most. I also focused my time on not just my work but also revising other people's work and making sure to problem solve any group conflicts. ","I would be a valuable partner due to my time in numerous officer positions ranging from President of the student school board to President of Wilson County’s Drug-Free Wilco Youth Prevention Coalition (which is a school organization funded and run in tandem with the county government). Via these positions I have learned to manage people, communicate with figures of authority, host group bonding events, and etc. 

On the more hard skills front, via my Capstone Diploma, I have learned how to curate proper research questions, as well as ethically conducting research, and presenting a 20 minute presentation without any flashcards. I would say that these hard skills would help boost the team's ability to choose manageable problems to solve as well as gain pointers on how to formally present.

These projects included using VEX parts to   design a solar powered car, autonomous guided vehicle, cookie sorter and marble sorter. Each project began with a specific prompt requirement. From there we each created a brainstorm and as a group constructed a decision matrix based on standards we saw fit. Standards included ease of build and effectiveness. We then evaluated each brainstorm based on how they met the criteria, ultimately deciding on the brainstorm that scored the highest. In some cases our brainstorms scored similarly so we collaborated on a design that incorporated components from each idea. We then created a CAD design of our final idea. Once our CAD was complete we began the building process, making adjustments to our design when necessary. Simultaneously we would begin writing the code. Once our design was built and coded we moved to the testing stage, ensuring that our final product met the requirements. 


Through each project I developed and refined both technical and teamwork skills that I was able to take into following projects. Each project we were randomly assigned with new members. This created the opportunity to work with a wide range of people and taught me how to adapt team dynamics with different personalities. I learned how to overcome conflict within the group and work efficiently depending on each members’ skill set.","One of my strongest qualities as a team member is my ability to observe. Observe the requirements of the project, the resources available to us, the skill sets of the other team members, etc. I am constantly gathering information that can be used to make our team more efficient and stronger. This characteristic is what sets me apart from others as I internally analyze all components of a situation to ensure that I am making a decision that is best for everyone involved. I take the information I gain and effectively apply it. 


In every situation I seek opportunities to learn and grow as an individual and team member. I am enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge and skill set, being able to apply new skills quickly. 


The best team is one that incorporates each and every member, combining everyone’s unique perspectives and skills in a way that creates a strong group dynamic. As a team member I prioritize communication within the team to make sure everyone is on the same page. I work to ensure all team members feel valued and included, being able to gain experience is all aspects of the engineering process.

Just like how the different Archimedes programs function we all dedicated ourselves to different roles so that we could efficiently build the benches. My job in the team was to gather materials and help assemble the bases and back boards of each of the benches. Working in this group setting I felt like I was confident in voicing my opinions while also accepting criticism and other solutions that were better alternatives to my own ideas. As a group we also made sure to not seclude ourselves to our work and involve everyone in the project allowing for a happy and productive environment that caused us to finish the project earlier than expected. ","What makes me a valuable member of the design team is my passion for innovation and the self learning that comes with it. Ever since I was little all I wanted to do was build something bigger than myself, be a part of something bigger than myself. Throughout my life so far I’ve looked for ways I can be a part of something bigger, but at the time I was too young and lacked the experience. Now through Archimedes I have that chance, I have the opportunity to create something with my fellow teammates that could actually impact the world. I could finally take a step toward my younger self’s dream and completely design, model, and build a prototype with like minded peers. I think this is exactly why I would make a valuable member of the design team. With the opportunity to create this prototype I would take the time to learn any type of topic. If I could implement the topic onto the project I would love churning through different ideas and learning about how they would work on our design.

It comes naturally to me, as I have always liked being the one everyone comes to with their ideas, work, and questions. I also love being able to put everyone's work together into one cohesive product. I think my personality also lends itself to group work because though I would describe myself as outgoing and extroverted, I'm not loud and always wanting to be the one speaking. When I lead a team I can make sure the quieter members of the team are heard as well as the louder ones since, in ways, I can relate to both sides. As a member of a team, having teammates that rely on me motivate me to get my work done on time and with accuracy. I take pride in my portion of the work and constantly strive for it to be as good as it can possibly be.

This viewpoint would allow our team to come up with creative ideas and solutions to problems by being able to think about them in a different way. Bringing in ideas and ways of thinking from a physics background will also help us stand out amongst our competitors that might not have members with different majors and backgrounds. In addition to my abilities with the technical aspect of creating and building a product, I have long been involved in the arts, having done both digital and traditional art, violin, photography, and writing, as well as sewing, knit, and crochet. All of those different arts have changed how I see the world and have greatly improved how I express the things I've learned in stem in the real world. Bringing a creative outlook to an otherwise stem-centric project, while having the stem foundation and credentials as well, would no doubt give our team an edge. As a personality on the team, my bright demeanor, never-ending curiosity, ability to pick up skills quickly, and my willingness to help and share my experience with others will create a positive environment, and my strong drive and ambition will help push us to success.","Thank you so much for the opportunity to apply and the incredibly helpful interest meeting.

I say the optimization part took up the most effort from me as the robot would always be breaking down in some way or another (one of my goals for this design team is to improve my designs’ reliability).

In terms of teamwork, communication and collaboration were essential. We divided tasks based on each team member's strengths, but regularly came together to discuss progress and solve problems as a unit. I learned the importance of listening to others' ideas, providing constructive feedback, and adapting my approach when necessary. 

As a younger kid, I would always criticize the exorbitant amount of time my parents spent in meetings. During our most recent season I also spent far too much time in meetings. I’ve realized that to function effectively as a team the most important thing is to make sure everyone knows what’s going on at all times. Even if someone comes up with a brilliant idea it doesn’t matter if it isn’t communicated clearly. This experience, among many others, taught me how to function efficiently in a group, manage time, and work towards a common goal.","I believe my passion for engineering, combined with hands-on experience in projects like robotics, would make me a great edition to any one of your design teams. I've always had a deep curiosity for how things work and a desire to push the limits of what I can create. In my past projects, particularly in mechanical design, I’ve experienced hacking at a problem longer than necessary to achieve better and better results. While this persistence has helped me hone my problem-solving skills, I’ve also learned that as an engineer, knowing when to accept a ""good enough"" solution is crucial.

In engineering, balancing time, resources, and the project’s scope is essential, and I’m actively working on mastering that balance. My experience has taught me the importance of making decisions that are efficient and practical without sacrificing quality. This awareness has begun shaping how I approach teamwork and the iterative design process.

On your design team, I’d bring technical skills (CAD modeling, prototyping, and testing) but more importantly a commitment to continually refining my engineering mindset. My passion for innovation and willingness to learn from both successes and setbacks drive me forward. There’s always times with the team where we inevitably get frustrated, but that makes a finally working product feel that much more refreshing. I’m eager to contribute my dedication and creativity to the team while learning from others to achieve the best possible experience.",,,,

I was able to work with a group over twenty-four hours to create the whole application, and since we were working in such a short period of time, I learned a great deal about how I function in a team setting. Some of my biggest strengths are delegating tasks, and I really enjoy communicating and getting information between different people about the parts of the project they’re working on. When two different people have issues, I’m able to decide what to prioritize. I love to collaborate with others, and have learned that I do my best work in a team setting, where I’m able to inspired by and build off of the ideas of others. I love being taken in a new direction by an idea I would have never thought of.","As a member of one of your design teams, I'd be able to bring a mix of both technical and soft skills. I enjoy coding, and can being C++, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Python, Java, and R knowledge. I've completed projects that explore artificial intelligence, computer vision, simulation, and more. In addition, I'm interested in biotechnology as well, so if we end up exploring a biocoding route, I'd be able to help out with topics such as cell or fungal culturing, laboratory skills, and more! I also love learning new things and coding languages, and would love to pick up some new skills! On the soft skills side, I love to read and write technical documents, so in a case where we'd need to review research done about a specific coding topic, I'd love to help! I also would be able to help write documentation for whatever solution we create. I also love communicating and presenting, and would really enjoy tackling the challenge of creating a presentation for our solution.",Nothing else!

As the Director of Unity and Membership for Future Business Leaders of America, one of the components of my role was to foster effective teamwork. While we had many tasks to complete, each that required different levels of knowledge and experience, I had to effectively allocate certain tasks to certain people and keep the team focused on common goals. In this setting, I was able to identify and play on each members strengths in order to create the best results. Additionally, any tasks that didn't get completed were completed by me in order to ensure that everything was finished and no one member was burnt out. In a general team setting, my ideal role would be evaluating and identifying the strengths of each person and the tasks corresponding to them. Then, I would also fill in the gaps so everything runs smoothly as well as ensure that  the team is satisfied and focused overall. ","The project that impacted me the most is Chantilly Scholars, a high school organization dedicated to providing resources and knowledge to high-achieving students struggling to cross barriers, including economic and language barriers. In my senior year, I became the first-ever student leader and worked very closely with teachers and administrators in order to turn a 7 person club into over 55 people. Every month, I would present different opportunities, events, and aid in the community. Additionally, I planned various field trips from inviting 6th graders to our technology academy to visiting colleges. We gifted students books as well as let them pick their own. These results and many more were only possible through a tremendous amount of hard work and dedication, most of the time, sacrificing my lunchtime to meet with teachers and sponsors in order to get work done ahead of time and done perfectly. Through that time, I was able to form a close relationship with my teacher and we still talk and meet to this day. Through this experience, I was able to taste the fruit of my hard work, form close relationships with members, and learn so much about leadership and teamwork.

I serve as Chief Technology Officer, leading our software development team and overseeing its growth/development as we iterate through prototypes and constantly improve our software. I train members on how to work as part of a software development team, teaching them to break problems into smaller, more manageable parts and work towards a larger goal. Furthermore, I developed team members into leaders by coaching them on designing and implementing project plans, assigning tasks to subteam members, and interviewing new candidates when needed. 
Another group effort I participated in was the Children’s Science Center’s Youth Advisory Board, a group of 28 high school students who promote STEM education by designing events and educational content for elementary and middle school students. I served as Co-Chair, planning our overall board agenda, selecting and training leaders, and ensuring member engagement. Similarly to Minvest, I trained and oriented members in professional skills like management, working across subteams, and communication so that the board could operate efficiently. 
","My experience designing an application from scratch as part of a team is very similar to the intent of Archimedes' design teams. The way I functioned in the previous group setting (Minvest) is directly translatable to Archimedes. Especially in the initial stages, I researched and learned new skill sets through YouTube to develop Minvest. For instance, I extensively researched how to implement a toolset called REST APIs, because I originally had no idea how to connect the frontend and backend parts of our code. As mentioned in the interest meetings, the ability to learn new topics through research is very important to be successful on an Archimedes team, and my experience implementing new skills learned through the internet would be very valuable to the team. Additionally, my leadership and the ability to help others are some of the core strengths I have demonstrated through leading software development at Minvest and the Youth Advisory Board at the Children’s Science Center, and I would be excited to bring these skills to Archimedes teams.","I would strongly prefer joining the Astra or Terra since I would love and would be excited to design a physical prototype or system for the first time to further diversify my skillset (rather than just code/software development).

Me and three other seniors brought up the idea of mulch delivery to our coach to bring the team money needed for newer equipment. We convinced him of the idea and he let us lead the program. Through the fund raiser, we each individually took up task such as outreach to buyers, purchasing of mulch, and organizing sub teams of participating players. I took up the role organizing the sub teams of players, but did not hesitate to help in other facets of the program. I enjoyed the team environment of the program and loved to coordinate the overall mulch fund raiser.

Additionally, I was a part of a team project for one of my high school engineering classes. In this project, we had to design a prototype building to survive multiple magnitudes of earthquakes on a shake table. In this group, we all had to participate in research, design, and construction of the prototype. I was a part of every element in the process from figuring out what architecture works for certain magnitudes and how elements could be combined. This lead me to propose copying the Taipei 101's seismic damper and using it in the final design. In construction, I worked well with multiple people doing the same task at once and was willing to take up leadership when we had teammate disagreement or issues with the budling. Overall, it was great experience in the essence a of design team.","I am a valuable member of a design team due my passion for working in a group environment and pursuing a goal as one unit.

I tend to be the one to rally my friends to build cool projects together and share my passion for building/tinkering with them, but my ultimate hope is that they find the same enthusiasm in engineering as I do. However, I deeply believe that when I'm not leading, I need to be a key team player within a project. I recognize that the majority of the time, there is a much more knowledgeable person within a building team that should act as leader of the group and delegate the tasks to everyone.

These classes focused on STEM/Engineering concepts that provided me with the foundation for my future educational and career plans—these include computer designing, robotics, the design process, etc. PLTW is where I did most of my favorite group projects. Some of those group projects include building a mini hydraulic elevator, a bridge with a truss and beam system, things with VEX pieces like pulley systems, different types of gear trains, etc. In these team settings, I learned a lot about how I function in this kind of setting. I feel that I really thrive when I collaborate with others and this is when I can fully build on with my/other ideas. I think that in this setting my creativity is sparked and I am proud of the insight I can offer when solving a solution, but I am equally as enthusiastic when hearing my peers’ ideas and letting those flourish.","During high school, I learned a lot of valuable skills that I believe would be helpful to a design team. In the physics and math classes I took not only did I learn these topics but I also learned how to code in Pyret which is very similar to Python so I could learn that easily. I am very familiar with how to use VEX robotics and have made vehicles, pulleys, and more with this. I also know how to program the products I make from VEX and how to make them function. I am familiar with working in a woodworking shop and can use this type of tool when it comes to building. I have plenty of experience using programs like OnShape, Fusion 360, excel, and Autodesk Inventor, therefore, I know how to use CAD and CIM when it comes to projects. Lastly, last spring I interned for a packaging firm called Kari-Out and in this company, I worked with mechanical engineers to help them with their machinery and I learned how each machine worked, giving me some real-world experience in an expertise I am interested in.

I participated in FIRST robotics at my high school through all my 4 years, and was a team captain and build lead in my last 2 years. When I started off, I was assigned to the robotic arm subsystem, and it was a area that I really liked. I remember spending hours of time trying to design the perfect arm system in Autodesk Inventor, of course doing GD&T along the way to ensure proper fit. Ultimately, my design ended up working very well, and we only made minor adjustments to it throughout the season. But of course, robotics isn't anything without code, and although it wasn't my expertise, I remember spending countless hours with the programmers trying to troubleshoot various issues to the best of my abilities. After spending a lot of time with then debugging, I eventually learned to code in Java myself. That was the 2021-2022 season, and I really felt a strong passion for robotics, so much that I was appointed a scouting lead because of my knowledge of the game design that year. The following year, after the mentors and captain saw my dedication to the team, I was appointed as the build lead for my team, but of course had my fair share of engineering troubles there (I'll mention one instance in the next essay). However, after getting leadership training and advice from my mentors and parents, i was able to lead my team to the state championships where we got 2 design awards.","I am going to use my experiences in projects to exemplify the value I would bring. My first skill is that I performing well under pressure. It all began on the night of December 11th, when my robotics teammates and I finally completed our robot after three months of hard work. Everything was perfect—until we learned that one of our drivers, couldn't make it to the competition. Our team captain panicked, realizing he couldn’t reprogram the robot for solo driving. I stepped up to substitute, even though I had no prior practice. With some quick learning the next morning, I  was able to operate the robot's intake and conveyer system perfectly, and despite the challenges, we placed third and qualified for the state championships. 
I also have devotion while being focused, in that whenever I am assigned a task, I always focus completely on it until I can learn about it completely, and achieve success. This learn and do mindset helped me not only succeed in school academically, but also on my robotics team where my projects and subsystem worked well.
I am also well versed with skills like CAD, GD&T, Python, Arduino, and have recently started learn Circuits and PCB Design. I have worked on team projects, like a DC Generator, where I designed mechanical systems like the generator's Housing. Armature, and Yoke using CAD and added tolerancing and a drawing using GD&T.

Virginia Tech’s C-Tech² girls' engineering program was memorable as I implemented one of my ideas to create a unique product for college dorm students. By proposing to create a reverse osmosis water filtration system that would provide accessible drinking water, I contributed critical and creative thinking skills to this project. Although my group members did not understand how reverse osmosis worked, I ensured that my team understood this process by providing detailed explanations during which I enjoyed the creative designing process. I functioned well in this team setting by listening to other people’s ideas while implementing a few of my own. I understood the importance of efficient collaboration and task distribution based on one’s strengths to successfully create and present a product to faculty. Overall, this project ensured that I applied my knowledge of engineering while also learning from the knowledge and ideas of others. Another project I worked on involved hosting HIMUNC VII, my high school’s Model United Nations conference. As the Director General, I worked with my school’s Model UN Secretariat to host a conference for more than 300 delegates. This process took five months to plan and allowed us to give back to those in need by supporting the charity, Cancer LINC. By collaborating and giving each other feedback when necessary, we efficiently worked as a team to host this conference.","My participation in the Virginia Aerospace Science and Technology Scholars Program was significant as I improved my analytical skills by considering the future implications of previous NASA missions and . By working to design a long-duration Martian base mission at Langley Research Center with my team, I strengthened my ability to pay attention to mechanical details as I carefully considered rover sample collection and transit procedures. I further involved myself in engineering and computer science through the Kode with Klossy summer program. Through this program, my group and I worked together to create a personalized website using Python and presented it to Kode with Klossy faculty. These experiences have connected me with numerous individuals as I employed my leadership skills to problem-solve. I am certain that my engineering background, zeal for collaboration, and dedication to problem-solving will serve as sources of strength for me and others through being a part of my top choice, the ASTRA team. While my academic abilities will help me make an impact in data calculations and critical analysis, I believe my skills in leading and working with others, communicating, and paying attention to minute details will help me have a beneficial influence if I get the opportunity to work with a talented group of Virginia Tech students through ASTRA. I look forward to the prospect of employing my diverse skillset and opinions while continuing to investigate aerospace engineering.","Space has always fascinated me with its mysterious black holes, gargantuan planets, and vast unknown stretching beyond the darkness. I am captivated by the world outside Earth where stars lie as far as the eye can see. This is exactly why I wish to be a part of the ASTRA team to work toward my future dream career of becoming an aerospace engineer creating new rocket models that can reach farther into space than ever before.
	I came to realize my passion for aerospace engineering in high school during which I began doing elaborate research on NASA’s missions including the Challenger accident in 1986. This accident was particularly intriguing because I was eager to find out exactly what had caused such a powerful rocket to fail. My curiosity to learn more about rocket designs and space configurations is truly why I wish to be a part of ASTRA.
	Another reason why I am interested in ASTRA is because of the prior space technologies created by NASA and many other space agencies. By researching these breakthroughs, I have become transfixed by the desire to build state-of-the-art rockets while considering all of the thermodynamic and mechanical aspects. That is why by collaborating with others in ASTRA, I can work toward my future career and be part of something that could take space innovations to the next level. 
	One of my greatest aspirations within the field of aerospace engineering is to work with some of the most challenging mathematical and physics equations. I am enthralled by the prospect of struggling with intricate variables while scribbling down endless equations on whiteboards to calculate the exact amount of thrust needed for a rocket propulsion system to escape the wrath of Earth’s gravity. Computational fluid dynamics also seems like a highly intriguing topic that I wish to learn more about. This is why I am excited about possibly contributing to the data analysis and difficult mathematical calculations that will be involved in the ASTRA team’s tasks while learning more about the major that I aspire to pursue.",,,

The criteria included multiple complex swirls, and the marble had to take nine seconds to complete the roller coaster. This was my most tedious and stressful project. To work in a group setting, we had to be forgiving, understanding, and willing to work together for hours at a time. We also were forced to problem solve after tensions were very high, for instance when our project collapsed due to the weight of spray paint after working on our rollercoaster for two weeks, restarting from the ground up but due to our effective team work we were able to do so. ","I would be a valuable addition to the Juvo design team due to my ability to communicate effectively, organize my thoughts thoroughly, and my love for problem solving. Additionally, I am very passionate about hands-on work that makes the gears in my brain turn, instead of reciting information we’ve learned like in a typical classroom environment.  ","I would be honored to be a member of the Juvo design team, getting experience that would prepare me for my future career. Allowing me to explore my intended discipline would be an amazing opportunity I would love to be a part of. ","I was away over the weekend, the other absences were due to meetings with my hypatia group and class conflicts. ",,

My team ended up focusing on the walkable infrastructure of cities in Northern Virginia. I was a heavy contributor when it came to gathering the research, however, I would often collaborate with others on my team who would focus on other aspects of the project. Two people out of the five on the team had intermediate experience with programming, in which I was one of them. Because the team consisted of people of various technical skills, I needed to make sure that when explaining any data I gathered, I was able to explain and articulate clearly how it could benefit the team’s research. Needless to say, articulation and leadership were skills I quickly developed during this rigorous program and I believe it greatly contributed to our overall efficiency and effectiveness. ","I have intermediate experience when it comes to computer programming, specifically Java and Python. However, I am continuing to learn more languages such as JavaScript and C++. I believe I am always willing to learn new technical skills, especially ones that could be valuable to the design team I am keen on joining. Beyond just technical skills, though, I also have experience when it comes to communication and leadership. I’ve done programs and internships where the biggest skill I picked up was with how I presented my self and the solutions I offered. Regardless of the technical skills I learnt, it was important that clarity and leadership were skills that I would develop. I strongly believe I can incorporate this into Archimedes.",,,,

My peers and I created a school-wide competition, performed capacity building, and conducted research. A specific capacity-building project we undertook was the STEAM Hack Challenge. Our task was to design a machine that would undergo a series of chain reactions to direct a ball into a hoop. Immediately, I took on the role of a resource monitor and time manager. There were only three hours to complete this task, so I gave frequent updates on time to ensure a finished product by the end of the competition. I also found myself paying close attention to the supplies used for every part of the machine to ensure there was enough for every part of the machine. We could only use the supplies found within our team’s designated box, which acted as a limiter on the scale of the machine. Another experience was a mini-robot coding group project I engaged in at a cybersecurity summer camp. A mini-robot, known as Zumi, was required to navigate a maze of wooden Jenga blocks to reach the end without crashes and as fast as possible. Barring the robot’s error, a highly efficient code could be produced to have the Zumi turn whenever an object was sensed. Many variables determined how efficient our Zumi could be, such as speed, turn rate, and sensor distance. In this situation, I decided to work on the fundamental variables to ensure our Zumi was functional in its own right before tackling the advanced code.","I believe my reliability would be an asset to any team. To be authentic, when I am working on something alone there are times I may slack off because I know it is affecting only me. However, things change when I am with a group. I have always found myself extra motivated to tackle the challenge and less likely to give up. I also feel that I generally work best in a team. Usually, when tackling a moderately difficult project alone, I find myself making mistakes and hindered by small gaps in my knowledge. Something obvious to a teammate may be the last thing I would personally think of. Another asset I would bring is time management. Whether a project/competition is timed or not, my main goals are to have a working product early to avoid burnout and leave room for meticulous testing to ensure our product works flawlessly by the eventual presentation time.",,,,

In my Intro to Robotics class, everyone was assigned pairs for the semester. My partner and I worked very well in dividing the work into what we were comfortable and more familiar with. We also communicated before every assignment to reach an agreed end product which made us very successful. I had a group project in College Composition, the goal of which was to create an advocacy ad. My main responsibilities were to create an outline for the ad's scenes and to be an actor in the ad. As a team, we were very successful and won the best ad between all three College Composition classes. Finally, I was in the Tri-M Music Honor Society where I was in charge of the Music In Our Schools Month committee. My roles were to lead the discussions, decide what we could logistically do, and make the ideas happen by creating a plan and dividing up the work amongst other members. ","Overall I work very well in a team and with others. I understand the process of what goes into a successful team and how to make it happen. I have been trying to learn Python in my free time over the summer. I haven't been very good at it but I'm still trying. I have a lot of creativity when it comes to finding solutions and I could offer different point of views. I come from a mostly soccer and violin background. I played soccer for ten years and violin for eight. Unfortunately, I am struggling to think of any engineering strengths but I really so want to be a part of Archimedes and start my college experience with some amazing hands-on opportunities. The opportunities Virginia Tech has is one of the many reasons I came to this college and I am beyond excited to be here.  ",I have been learning by the books for the last 12 years and have been very concerned how I would actually become an engineer. I have very little on hands experience and when I found this club I was incredibly excited because this is the exact opportunity to make that jump from student to engineer. I have all of the books and school knowledge and now all I need is some experience. ,I attended a interest meeting,,

In all of the mentioned projects, I have been both a member and a leader at some point, and have worked with a diverse set of teammates (whether that be with their background, experience level, work ethic, beliefs, etc.) which have trained me to become a flexible, collaborative teammate.
I was always an ambitious team player where I was willing to take action on big projects, while planning it meticulously and making sure everyone’s opinion is heard and incorporating them. For example, I organized an outreach collaboration where my team worked with a local middle school during the summer and prepared mini-projects for middle schoolers, despite many thinking that we were reaching unrealistic goals. I was able to make sure all members could contribute to the project in different ways (preparing for the projects, presenting about robotics, helping the students with being hands-on, etc.), especially new robotics members and non-males as robotics can be an intimidating field. In the end, we were able to get more students interested in robotics and science.
With this, I am still willing to learn new things with and/or from everyone as there are still technical skills I have not yet mastered and I hope to learn new perspectives on solutions from being in a diverse team.","Three characteristics that make me a valuable team member are having strong soft skills that make me compatible with any combination of teammates, my dedication to a project, and curiosity to explore and learn with others.
With my soft skills, I am able to collaborate well with others with open communication (during and outside of meetings), making compromise between ideas, and a strong empathy for others. These skills can be applied in many different situations, even like discussing expectations and ground rules between members in my dorm suite, but I understand the importance of these soft skills when working with a design team especially. 
I am also a very dedicated person with whichever project I participate in. Even as a new freshman, I do not plan on joining every engineering club at Virginia Tech as I know where my interests lie and want to be committed to just a few selected projects. I enjoy being focused on in-depth projects since it allows me to really feel and be present in the engineering process, which I do believe is an important part of the learning experience. 
Lastly, I am a very curious person in general and I believe that is why I learn and accept things with an open mind. Due to my curiosity in projects, I have worked on several different types of projects and have tried/prototyped different solutions within those projects. I hope to do the same with the design team I get into at Archimedes and to also bring in new perspectives from my diverse experience.","I am intending to be an Industrial & Systems Engineering (ISE) major and understand that it may not be as technical as other engineering majors. However, my goal in joining Archimedes is to have this opportunity in learning more technical things I may not learn in my major as well as staying engaged with students who are in other majors. 
Additionally, I wanted to put here my ranking of which design teams I would prefer to go into. It would first be Terra as the competition prompt seems interesting. Second would be Astra because the testing part of the engineering process is different from past projects. 
I thank you all ahead of time! ",,,

One in particular that stands out to me was my senior year IB Physics class. Their me and three others in our group were tasked to construct a roller coaster track out of any material we wanted that could sustain the weight of a remote controlled ball going through the track. Within a group setting it is best in my opinion to delegate tasks to certain team members in order for their to be focus on what is to be done and asked of us. I was tasked with the sketch and overall design of the track, another group member was tasked with finding the right materials for construction, the other was tasked with heading the construction, and lastly the last person was the scribe recording information in the document and was the key to when we had to relay our information. Throughout the project although we had these set roles we often moved around checking in on other in their progress making sure they weren't struggling without receiving help. Even I wasn't shy to ask for help when needed even if it seems like I should know something or that it was my ""task"". The team overall had a big sense of openness in that we could rely on each other and no one was left behind. A team in this essence is like a family or community that every member was a part of. That was the group project that I remember the most due to how the team just flowed and felt like a great group to be apart of. ","     What would make me valuable member to any of the design teams is both my willingness to learn and my adaptability in a variety of environments. A key theme in any of these design teams seems to be that you don't need a ton of experience within any of these roles as this is supposed to provide freshman that experience. I have been in roles or places were I had no experience before but was able to be taught in order to learn, and thrive in that role. One notable example that comes to my mind was when I had to be a volunteer accountant for a local community organization in my town. When I was tasked to do that I had no experience whatsoever in accounting and managing finances. While the stakes were low since there was a mentor their for me I was going in that situation with no prior experience much like these design teams. I however was eager to learn and the mentor was able to teach me the ropes and I got a hang of the position overall. It taught me that passion and enthusiasm in what you are trying to learn and achieve goes a long way. That is honestly what I would bring  as a member of any of the design teams someone who is passionate and eager to fill the role that I am required of on the team and willing to collaborate and learn along the way in this experience.

I worked closely with my school peers, serving as a member who could understand the opinions of all, and also provide my own opinion as well, coming to a common consensus. I also was part of a team in Future Business Leaders of America this past year, placing top 12 in the world for designing a website for a nonprofit, with specialties for those who are color blind and prefer user friendly options, which required countless hours from all members. I specialized in keeping track of planned goals, communicating with members while also developing the website. Along with this, In 2023 and 2024, my FIRST Tech Challenge team was invited to the FIRST Global launches to present our ideas regarding robotics to government and corporate officials, and the founder of FIRST, which entailed extensive amounts of work. I was able to contribute through creating a presentation outline for each member to have an opportunity to shine while talking about their specialty they worked on. I thrive in a team setting, as I love to hear new opinions and ideas, while also being able to share my own, to create new innovations.","I have a strong love for computer science and technology, leading me to be part of FIRST for 8 years. For the past 5 years I have been part of a FIRST Tech Challenge team, the RoboLords, qualifying for state championship four times and world championship twice, including the recent one in Houston. I have had varying roles over the years such as being part of the robot inspection sub team, outreach lead, to being vice captain. I am able to adapt to any role from understanding and fixing niche technicalities, coordinating between members, external teams and officials, to overseeing sub teams ensuring optimum results. I have had exposure and experience in technical skills such as coding, building, and CAD design, yet also in understanding how to be a member who can make all feel like an equal part of the team, including being able to compromise and settle conflicts for the best of the team's goal.

I also attended a STEM school in high school where collaboration was an important part of how we learned in class such as group labs, research projects and collaborative homework. Through these experiences I have learned that I am someone who thrives in team settings, I truly enjoy the ability to share my ideas and solutions to problems with others and also hear their input. Putting all of our ideas together to produce the final product is the best part. I am very big on communicating in a group and ensuring everyone feels included in group discussions. I have also found working in a team makes a really good bonding experience. I tend to treat my team like my friends. Every long term team I have been in I have always left with a new group of friends who I consider as close to me as family. Spending so much time with them allows me to get close in a way I couldn’t have without. Overall I enjoy group collaboration and have had many positive experiences through team work and look forward to hopefully having more collaborative opportunities in the future.","I have knowledge in various aspects of STEM, during my time attending a STEM high school I obtained experiences within various STEM fields. I conducts a two year research project related to machine learning models and survival analysis. I’m also knowledgeable in robotics due to my participation in VEX robotics for 3 years. I learned a lot about subjects such as pneumatics, chassis gear ratios, drive trains and using CAD. In addition I am proficient in Python and Java, and can teach it to others since I have experience tutoring both languages to various age groups. I am also always ready to learn new things. Working in a team means sharing your knowledge with others and also receiving knowledge from them in return. This exchange of knowledge allows us to come up with creative ideas that we would not have developed on our own. I am always open to new things and constantly keep an open mind. Especially when trying to develop or design a product, keeping an open mind is very important. All four of the design teams archimedes offers fascinate and I would be very lucky to be a part of the team and the experience participating in design projects using resources my high school didn’t have the ability to offer me. ","I am also very experienced when it comes to professional presentation. In my STEM school, at the end of every year, we had a research symposium where we developed a presentation summarizing our research to professionals within the field of our research project. This experience allowed me to gain confidence in my public speaking skills and I learned how to properly summarize my work in a presentation alone with answering questions given to me during presentations.","During the first two meetings that were held I had classes with my LCC around the same time preventing me from attending, during the third meeting I got lost on a bus trying to get back to campus for the meeting, by the time I returned I came back too late.

Another example is being the Communications Director on a simple project on finishing and revising our mentor's publications, which involved tedious yet necessary work such as going through thousands of citations and references and reaching out to other scientists and engineers who have contributed to the world of Academia, to cross reference information and make sure the correct sources are cited.  Being a part of this team, allowed me to contribute in a multitude of ways and to see what functioning as a team member truly is, through various perspectives and roles. Apart from projects done, I can safely say that through being part of that team, I met some of my life-long friends. That is what I truly valued the most, the connections, which let me function with fluidity within the team. Naturally, with every team, there are disagreements and conflicts, but working through them was a valuable experience that prepared me for working with future teams and new groups. ","Communication, I believe, is the most imperative skill to master while working on any sort of team. After having participated in leadership positions in various extracurricular activities, I have a lot of experience working with various people with multiple different views and opinions. Being a part of a team requires effective and fluid communication amongst members and, equally as important, requires compromise in times of disagreement. In many instances, whether it was chairing meetings for Model United Nations or when, as the President of the National Honor Society, I had to delegate responsibilities and roles, I was faced with conflicts, which I chose to solve through meaningful conversations with my peers, helping me understand not only their greatest strengths and weakness but also my own. I realized that collaboration and leadership has always been and always will be my most valuable skills and contribute to my passion for forming powerful bonds with those already around me and reaching out to form strong connections with those I wish to work with. My experience with leadership and my people-oriented personality allows me to be an effective member of any team that I am in. I strive to make sure all members of the team are comfortable in the environment they work in and with the people they work with.

My enthusiasm for design stems from wanting to solve problems and creating impactful solutions. Participating in design teams gives me the opportunity to do something I enjoy, solving critical problems, while also getting to collaborate with others. 
I also thrive in projects with a hands-on mentality, whether it is sketching out various prototypes, experimenting with different ideas, or collaborating with team members to approach the best solution. The engagement from hands-on projects and actively contributing as well as promoting a space for collaboration are environments I want to be involved in and grow from. In past projects, I have brought an inclusive and collaborative environment and I would love to continue to spread that strong collaborative setting to one of the Archimedes design teams.
Additionally, my eagerness to learn and grow within the engineering field is something I believe is valuable. I am always excited to embrace new tools, techniques, and perspectives that can improve my technical knowledge and contribute to the project. My hope by joining Archimedes is mainly to have new experiences and be a part of a team where I can learn more from like minded peers. By combining my passion, hands-on skills, and my goal of continuous learning, I am confident in my ability to make meaningful contributions to the Archimedes design teams.",I wanted to share my preference for working on the Terra team as I have selected multiple teams to be considered for. Terra is my main choice as I would like to gain a new experience and learn new skills. My 2nd choice would be Astra as the testing within this project is unique to the project I have done previously. Thank you so much for considering my application to Archimedes.,,,

We designed, built, and raced solar powered cars that were the size of a shoebox for Solar Sprint.  At the Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative Grand Prix, everyone wanted to be a driver, so I helped build the car and served as the Safety Officer for our high school teams that competed, as that was where I could help most. We had the fastest qualifying time and were consistently in the top two places during the race until another vehicle hit ours and damaged it to where it couldn’t run. However, we kept a positive attitude and behaved professionally.  We were awarded the fastest qualifying time and good sportsmanship awards. I did an internship in neuroscience at Georgetown University Hospital, where we worked on a team research project. We only had a week to write the paper, so we had to work hard and collaborate effectively under pressure. I demonstrated strong skills in teamwork and communication under pressure while working as a Pharmacy Technician for one year at Rotz Pharmacy. For my Eagle Scout Project, I recruited and trained 30+ adult volunteers to clean 180 tombstones, photograph and upload them, and type up all the Friends cemetery records from the archives to preserve the information. I can be a good leader or a good team member, depending on what is needed. I have a flexible and adaptive leadership style.","As a Mechanical Engineering Intern with the US Army Corps of Engineers Transatlantic Division, Middle East District, I used Revit, Civil3D, and Infraworks as part of a four-person team that designed an educational center where people could receive training and grow community connections while practicing community supported agriculture. I was responsible for plumbing, heating, and air conditioning. I had to quickly respond to any adjustments by other team members to ensure the quality of the design and success of the project. We each presented our designs to US Army military commanders and civilian engineering officials. I learned many communication and project management skills, as well as presentation skills. I have experience working effectively in teams with diverse people and goals as a military kid who lived in different states and two foreign countries. My experience in other cultures has taught me to be adaptable, work hard, have empathy, and to make the most of my opportunities. I understand how important communication, compromise, and a good attitude are. It also taught me about leadership, time management, determination, and to be willing to try new things.","As an intended biomedical engineering major, I want to use engineering solutions to solve medical and scientific problems, and to give people the best opportunity to succeed. Since I saw my first Star Trek episode as a kid, I have been incredibly interested in space exploration, helping to advance scientific knowledge, and making the world a better place for everyone. I’m also fascinated with using what we have in new and creative ways to help people with disabilities. After attending the Health Sciences Academy, I job shadowed a cardiologist over the holidays and the summer. I enjoyed learning about the different medical devices and how physicians analyzed data to come up with the best solutions. This has led me to want to develop medical devices to save lives and help people have a better quality of life in my future career.  This is why I am so determined to join Archimedes.",,,

The only problem was that, while I had the motivation to wake up, my ears would block out all the noises from the alarms. This challenge inspired me to create an alarm system that sprayed water on my face. Lacking hardware knowledge, I asked two friends to join me on the project. As the team lead, I decided the best approach was to split the group into three teams: software, hardware, and testing. Over the two months, we faced many challenges—such as the motor not properly pumping water, the water only shooting in one spot, and air getting trapped in the water pipe. To address these issues, we met every weekend to review progress and help each other solve problems. Although this project wasn’t huge, it sharpened my teamwork skills.","I believe I’d be a valuable member of your design team because I work well with others and enjoy tackling problems. I’m good at organizing tasks and making sure everything stays on track while keeping everyone’s input in mind. I’m comfortable taking initiative when needed to get things done and I also value listening to ideas from my teammates. I don’t mind taking a backseat during projects and just being a supportive team member if that’s what’s best for the group. I like to believe that I am committed to working hard and finding the best solutions, and I’d bring that same drive and teamwork to your design team. ",,,,

Although these projects seem to be on opposite ends of the spectrum, they both helped me develop valuable teamwork and technical skills for future endeavors.
In the robotics class, we were tasked with designing a robotic arm that could pick up a marker and write a sentence on a whiteboard—despite only having basic CAD and Arduino experience. Because the project required skills beyond what I initially had, I had to seek out extra resources to seek out new information and quickly acquire expertise to better contribute to my team’s success.
Teamwork was also crucial, especially when it came to trusting one another to meet deadlines. This sense of accountability carried over to my Spanish Flu presentation. In that project, I was responsible for researching the pathology of the disease. It required me to ask the right questions, read academic articles, and develop a deep understanding of the topic—not only to help craft the presentation but also to confidently answer follow-up questions from our teacher.
In both projects, my teams and I earned an A, a testament to the effort and collaboration we put into the work.
","One of the most valuable assets I bring to a team is trust. In the projects I mentioned earlier, I was trusted to complete my tasks on time and ensure that I had done thorough research beforehand. This was especially critical in the Spanish Flu project. During our presentation, our teacher asked specific, challenging questions that were part of our grade. If I hadn’t fully understood the topic, we would have lost crucial points on this heavily-weighted assignment.
In the robotic arm project, my team relied on me to work hard during class time, both designing and assembling the arm. Although we couldn't get the robotic arm to pick up the marker and write, the effort and dedication we put into the project didn’t go unnoticed by our teacher, and we were still given an A.
Equally important was learning to trust others. Time constraints were one of the biggest hurdles during the robotic arm project, and I couldn’t work on it during our study-hall period due to personal commitments. I reached out to two teammates, trusting them to handle some assembly issues. Even though we had faced obstacles before, I knew that by trusting them, they would follow through—and they did, allowing us to move forward with the project.
In summary, what makes me a valuable member of any design team is my ability to not only fulfill the trust and responsibilities placed on me but also to trust my teammates to do the same.

Topics such as Anatomy and Physiology or Codebusters (cryptography) were assigned to us. Tasked to learn as much about these topics as possible, it involved a great deal of teamwork and collaboration. We were left to fend on our own; from scouring for resources online and in the library, doing extensive research, and preparing tirelessly. It was a multi-month-long group project for each topic. In this team setting, I planned out things like buying materials needed for the competitions, get-together times, and I resolved disputes. My three years at Science Olympiad not only gave me the confidence to start learning anything from scratch and the research skills to do so, but it also gave me valuable experience in long-term group projects and human factors, such as issues in communication, coordination, and differing opinions. Science Olympiad taught me to approach a team setting not with just the goal of winning, but also with the intention to build camaraderie and build healthy ways of communicating ideas. Another group project I worked on was in my Cyberpatriot club, a cybersecurity competition club, where teams were tasked to create a compromised system. It meant reverse-engineering compromises as well as communicating and compiling our collective knowledge and strengths to create fixable cybersecurity issues. This project taught me to rely on others’ knowledge and value it. ","	Although I have limited technical knowledge in things like engineering and coding, I have the tenacity to step outside my comfort zone and learn beyond my current abilities. Whether it’s Science Olympiad, Cyberpatriot, or even academics, I have encountered challenges where I knew nothing in the beginning but by the end, through hard work, I was able to learn a great deal. Coming to Virginia Tech, I hope to continue this trend of stepping outside my comfort zone and learning something when starting from zero. I also genuinely have a passion for learning. From watching YouTube videos after a Calculus 3 lecture to see how the vector dot product is applied to video game design to finding out how gyroscopic precession works after learning about rotational motion after physics class, I love learning theoretical mathematics and science and seeing how it’s applied to engineering real world is fascinating to me. Through one of the engineering design teams, I will be able to participate in this engineering process in real time. For these reasons, Archimedes is the perfect club for me as I’ll be surrounded by freshmen who have the same limited knowledge, but, also like me, are wholly motivated to learn the design process for an engineering system. I will be a valuable member of one of the design teams precisely because of my tenacity and passion for learning, but also because I want to grow alongside other freshmen and learn from their repertoire of skills and experiences.

Though my VEX journey was quite short I made sure to gain all the knowledge I could. This taught me to learn faster by asking lots of questions and being curious. I quickly learnt that adapting to different strategies and making design decisions based on other teams strategies as well as based on our bot was really important. This allowed me to be more creative and help my team come up with new types of bot designs with constant iterations to ultimately come up with the perfect bot. 

While the design teams taught me a lot too about the different engineering disciplines, I believe the main thing would be that I was able to experience working in a group of 30 high school kids who all worked within different disciplines and came together to pull together one design project. The design project also came with a lot of design constraints which also pushed me to learn to design very unique designs and learn how to still make it realistic.

Through all these teams I learnt that in different team situations, I had to function as a different type of a member, sometimes be the leader, or sometimes follow someone else along. "," 
All these teams have made me learn how to work with different people but have also taught me how to learn and adapt quickly to different targets and situations. They have given me knowledge on people and about design and engineering. 

I have also worked on many different engineering projects throughout highschool in engineering classes within my school where we learnt to make bottle rockets, pinhole camera and many more.

One specific lab that stuck out to me involved calculating the trajectory of a steel ball in order to make it land on a frisbee. If the frisbee was on level ground it wouldn't have been much of a challenge. However, the frisbee was on a chair that was above the launch point, which greatly amplified the challenge. Without using calculus, it was a real feat especially since we only had one shot to get it right. Our team faced several setbacks and made numerous errors, but we persevered. A major role I played was coming up with a lot of the calculations. These included the distance, height, and time of the launch.

 Finally after an entire class period of intense work, we were ready to take our shot. We loaded the steel ball into the launcher, and stared intensely as it sailed across the table. There was a dead silence before we heard the satisfying clink of metal landing on plastic. We had succeeded. 

This specific experience stands out to me because of the satisfaction of my team's hard work paying off at the end. This was a moment of accomplishment that solidified my desire to pursue engineering. There is no satisfaction like seeing your project succeed as planned. If I could do this in a classroom setting, I'm confident I can do this in larger scale challenges in the future including the Archimedes team.","One of my strongest qualities is communication. Communication is arguably one of the most crucial qualities of an effective team. 
An opportunity that greatly improved my communication skills is my job at Chick-fil-a. At our employee training they had us do a rather strange exercise. They instructed our large group line up in alphabetical order. Although we had no idea why they were making us do this we did as we were told in about two minutes. After we did this we were then told to line up in order of our birthdays. But this time we aren't allowed to talk. Still confused we did as we were told but this time it was much more difficult. In the end the managers went around asking everyone's birthday and we did not do such a great job. The owner then announced to us that this exercise was so we could see the importance of communication. We then all realized it wasn't just a silly icebreaker but an exercise to see that communication is a key skill to have in the workplace.
 After starting on the job I was able to significantly enhance my communication skills. Specific tasks that gave me practice include informing my coworkers of a customer's name, ensuring all parts of an order were received, and interacting with customers to ensure they leave with a smile. Although working at Chick-fil-a might seem like a typical fast-food job, it gave me a valuable opportunity to practice my communication skills.

Throughout our many hours in the program, we won our state championship in North Carolina and went on to compete in the world competition. However, accomplishing these feats would be impossible without incredible teamwork. Throughout our journey, each of us needed to have as much fun as possible while also retaining valuable skills for the real world. In doing so, it was important to form professional work environments and work hours, but also enjoying each other's company, not letting any negative scenarios get in between us as a group.","I believe throughout my robotics journey, people always looked up to me as someone they could rely on and come to in need of assistance, which is an aspect of my personality I would like to uphold throughout my life.

We always did problem 2, known as ""the technical problem"". We would brainstorm ideas and split work amongst each other and often get things done on our own time, but closer to competition we'd meet up more often to finish work together and rehearse. We usually got together fine, but did sometimes have disagreements and conflicts, in which I was able to figure things out and we always stayed together as a functioning team, for all of high school.

        At the beginning of senior year, we got right to work. We brought all our stuff at this point into class and began working in the shop. We laid out our frame and marked our cuts. Because we had steel pipes, we would have to take fish mouth cuts, which were hard to do. We had test runs on the welder before we used it on the frame. It was both our first time working with one. I picked it up easy over the first month, with my partner doing most of the cutting. We tested the frame multiple times during drop tests. We then moved onto the hard part for the rest of the year. It was adding on everything else. We struggled countless times on this project where we would have to alter our design and parts so that they fit in and connected with each other. Funny thing, our steering was inverted by accident. We realized after the bracket had been welded on. It was okay because it was thin and was okay to cut open again. It was a simple fix. We removed the axle and flipped it over then welded it back on. We also had problems with the braking, seat, throttle cable, wheels, and rear axle. In the end, we got everything to come together to perform. We impressed all of our engineering teachers and were highlighted on the school's social media. We were the spotlight at the STEM night. I just felt so amazing that our work paid off. And my partner and I were ready for the next chapter in our lives where we'd hopefully work together again.",I am excellent at brainstorming and coming up with ideas. I believe a strong team should have great communication skills and work together. That is what separates people. I am great at bringing people together to collaborate to attack the task at hand.

I am also a volunteer firefighter in my town for over 2 years and now joining Blacksburg fire. The thing I am most proud of is Connect Tech. My school district recently transitioned to a heavier reliance on technology by distributing Chromebooks to all students. Since the shift, I noticed a multitude of devices being broken (my brother’s included). I filled the need for Chromebook repair, which saves the schools thousands of dollars to be put back into their educational programs.

Our combination of skills allowed for a multidisciplinary approach to the project that utilized our individual talents. Along the way, we were able to share information that left us both with more insight into the other's field of study. Our project was an autonomous week picker called Green Guard. It pulled out weeds and deposited in a box for disposal used a machine learning algorithm to determine which plants were weeds, and which ones weren't. As my partner's specialty was computer science, I was able to learn how to create a database and implement it into a raspberry pi. My responsibilty were the chasis and design of the robot. Green Guard was made of mostly 3D printed materials that I designed in SolidWorks. The rest was made of wood or metal carved using CNC machining, and upcycled parts. Our main mechanisms were a rack and pinion gear and a pulley system. My partner and I worked well together because we knew our strengths and weaknesses and filledl in the gaps for each other. Even when we were putting together the circuitry to connect the motor drivers and DC motors to the raspberry pi, we had to ask for help and use our unique perspectives to complete it. In a team, my priority is that everyone's ideas are heard and each member comes out more knowledgeable and informed. ","I believe my technical expertise would be a valuable addition to a deisgn team and they all require some level of mechanical design, CAD knowledge, and coding algorithms.

Aside from engineering skills, I provide a host of interpersonal skills as well. My passion for aerospace engineering anf hands on learning in general ensures that I will be a dedcated and hard working member of the team.

I had the opportunity to optimize circuit performance by conducting extensive testing and analysis on various components along with students by utilizing my past three years of experience in competitive robotics as a competitor and mentor. I then continued to pursue philanthropic efforts for a cause that aligns with my identity as a first generation, Latin women in stem by integrating myself as an E.L.I.T.E Committee member for Latinas Leading Tomorrow where I  organized events that raised awareness about the organization's mission and expanded its reach within the community and represented the non-profit at external conferences and forums. Both of these experiences served me in advancing my communication skills in both written reports and professional presentations that allowed me to translate my experience and passions. Such skills are what I actively use to collaborate within a team work centric field that supports open discussion of ideas, all towards innovation and discovery.

Archimedes and its design teams encompass the vastness and complexities of the engineering field, and as a first-year engineering student at Virginia Tech I wish to break these down further into its core electrical systems along with my team members. Specifically, archimedes will allow me to share my past experiences where they can fully excel with the guidance of upperclassmen and the support of my peers. Most impactful was my time as a mentee and intern for BAE Systems where I was one of twenty selected to facilitate solutions and operate machinery in a high clearance environment under leading female electrical engineers, increasing proficiency and expanding my technical skill set within the electrical discipline. Additionally, through an experience with the Virginia Space Grant Consortium and NASA’s Langley Center, I composed designs along with case studies regarding both the technical and ethical sides of engineering with a strong focus on past projects within the development of aerospace, all while under the title of Virginia Aerospace Science and Technology Scholar.

After school, I would attend a computer club called VA Star. This is where me and my peers would fix the hardware and software of the computers and laptops. We would do patching, where we would update the software such as updating the Microsoft Windows software to its current version, on these devices. We would also replace the hardware of the broken or damaged laptops and computers including replacing old hard disk drives with new ones. Once we fixed the laptops and computers, we would send them back to the local communities who sent the devices at our club.","I am a curious learner, resilient, and adaptable to any situation. When I joined VA Star, I didn’t know how to fix computers and laptops, but with my curious mindset, I was able to fix the devices in a quick manner. During the VA Star program, I faced many challenges like patching large amounts of computers and laptops for communities to use. In addition, replacing many hardware parts for a computer or laptop was an obstacle that I, along with my group, faced.",,,,

One of the requirements to become an Eagle Scout is planning, organizing, and executing a service project. The project I chose was to renovate a local park’s fields with the help of a group of volunteers. This was by far the most intensive extracurricular project I had ever undertaken and it required me to expand my cooperation and planning skills. I was tasked to lead two dozen volunteers and walk them through my plan, which naturally led to debate and ultimately a revision as the project forced me to cooperate with more experienced individuals. While others helped with logistics and funding, my main contribution to the project was designing the renovations and being the point of contact with the town parks and recreation department to ensure the project could continue. The biggest takeaway from this project that translates to Archimedes the ability to problem solve on the fly. Just a week before the project I sprained my ACL, making the physical labor much more difficult. In the same week, the parks department shortened the time frame we had to complete the project. Despite these challenges, I was able to grind through my part of the project and notify the volunteers of the new date. These skills will be a benefit to the team because it shows I work well in a team, can solve problems on a dime, and persevere through hardships.",I think I would be a valuable member to the design teams because although I am not experienced in engineering design I have a passion for engineering and am willing to give my all to a team that would allow me to expand my knowledge about the engineering design process. I have worked well in the past in extracurricular group organizations and projects that needed to be ran efficiently and remain on track without the guidance of anybody above the student leadership level. I was part the executive board for my schools' FBLA chapter which competed on the national level. That experience taught me how to plan and mange time effectively in a cooperative group setting to get projects done on time. This skill in particular will help me the most in Archimedes would I be accepted. Aside from that I am quick learner and am eager to be a part of such an amazing group.,,,,

Electrathon is an electric vehicle building competition geared towards motor efficiency, weight-reduction and aerodynamics. I officially joined the team at my school for the fall race at the start of my sophomore year. I hit the ground running. I collaborated with my team members, and learned a whole lot of important information from some of the upper-classmen members. I made sure to ask many questions and learn as much as I could. I was also able to add insight from my prior knowledge, and as a team we were able to place eighth for the fall race and sixth in the spring. The following year, I was voted in to the position of Lead Engineer, the highest ranking position, because of the knowledge I had gained the previous year and the problem-solving, building and design skills I had demonstrated. As the leader of the team, I was tasked with designing our vehicle, and leading the build process. I thrived in this position. We spent weeks designing and building our new car for the year, and I made sure that every member had a role - it was a full team effort. Because of the wide range of perspectives we had, we were able to build what we felt was the best car in the program's history. This proved to be true. We placed third in the fall race, and perfected our car for our second place finish in the spring. These were the two best placings in the many years of Electrathon racing at my high school.","I am extremely passionate and driven when it comes to engineering. I have known I wanted to be an engineer for as long as I can remember. As a kid, I can recall spending much of my time working on Arduino projects, making bottle and model rockets, and building go karts. When I reached high school, this passion blossomed even further. I joined every engineering class that was offered, and I excelled. I received the Most Outstanding Student in Engineering Award my sophomore year for my performance in these electives. I also joined many extracurriculars because in-school classes didn't feed my passion enough. Most notably, I founded a STEM Honor Society in my junior year. I led this club as the president for two years, and our main focus was unlocking children's love for STEM. We held numerous events with fun and engaging STEM projects in our town for young children to benefit from. We also built and donated projects for STEM demonstrations in the classroom like a large scale Newton's Cradle with bowling balls for physics classes. In all, my love and passion for engineering and problem-solving is just beginning. I know I can achieve great things, and a platform like Archimedes looks like the perfect start.",,,,

One of the more notable group projects I've participated in is a project within the Virginia Governor's World Language Academy. Through the World Language Academy, specifically the Japanese Academy, I got to meet and create relationships with over 30 students and faculty coming from all over Virginia. Within the academy, we had small groups aimed at helping the flow of the academy as a whole. In my group, our task was to show our appreciation to the guest speakers who came a taught us about the history or culture of the Japanese language, and these guest speakers were often professors or just professionals in their fields. Apart from thanking our guest speakers, we also had to create memorabilia for the academy members by using high-tech machinery like CNC Machines and Laser Cutters. Our group would tackle these tasks as a whole allowing multiple perspectives, opinions, and ideas to be included producing the best result possible. In this group, I tried to emphasize the necessity for everyone to be included and have their perspective shared in some way. I wanted to make sure that everyone felt included and that everyone got the opportunity to share their thoughts and ideas because I knew that any one of these ideas could change the perspective on the project as a whole and put us on a path to a better result. ","If I were to be accepted into any of the Archimedes teams, I'd make sure that I can make a positive, helpful, and insightful impact on the team. I think that everyone in the group should be participating or contributing in some way, I feel that if that happens and we can all work together then we can accomplish the best possible result that we can. Furthermore, when it comes to hands-on work which very well could be a big part of the team, I can confidently say that I'd be on task, dedicated, and working diligently to complete my task correctly and as quickly as possible. Apart team setting behavior, I believe I'd fit well into a team at Archimedes because I have some background experience that can be applied to the team. In high school, I took two STEM electives which allowed me to gain CAD, CNC Machine, Laser Cutting, 3D Printing, and Wood/Acrylic experience. Within that STEM class, I had projects such as building a functional gumball machine with a working gear system, a miniature bridge, non-electronic speaker, and I was even tasked to create items that would be used for the school. Outside of that STEM class, I had Laser Cutting experience through the Virginia Governors Japanese Language Academy where my group and I cut out wood in a specific Japanese design and distributed them as memorabilia for the members of the academy. Furthermore, I have light experience in Java as I took AP Computer Science in High School and I am enrolled in an Intro to Software Design Course. ",,,,
